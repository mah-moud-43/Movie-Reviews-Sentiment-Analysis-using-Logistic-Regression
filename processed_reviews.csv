How to Train Your Dragon,Action,"Whatever happened to Brenton Thwaites? For some reason that crossed my mind as this thoroughly entertaining fantasy adventure gets off to a rollicking start and keeps going. Now if you are the “Hagar”-esque Viking chief (Gerard Butler) expecting your son to take over as fearless dragon-chaser after you, why would you call him “Hiccup”? Might as well call him “Buttercup”? Anyway, that hapless lad (Mason Thames) maybe isn’t the most adept on the muscle front but cerebrally he has something of the Leonardo Da Vinci to him as he determines to set about devising a weapon that will tackle the most formidable of their foes - the “Night Fury”. Well, would you believe it - his contraption actually works, but instead of slaying the thing this young man decides that the decades of combat between the species has accomplished nothing, so he decides a bit of co-operation might be in order instead. Of course, he has to be fairly clandestine about this as his dad will go ape if he finds out and fellow, and competitive, student “Astrid” (Nico Parker) - on whom he has a terrible crush - might decide to take her axe to both him and his new friend. There are a few slight modifications from the animation (2010) but otherwise it largely sticks to the story with a lovely hammy effort from Butler, an enjoyably mischievous one from his multi-appendage sidekick “Gobber” (Nick Frost) and two solid performances from the leads. It’s Thames who really steals the show amongst the humans, with a cheeky and personable effort which must have been quite a task as he spent much of the filming dangling in front of a green screen. As to the visuals, they are great. A combination of dragons galore, huge scale pyrotechnics and loads of imagination immerses you into a story of family and friendship without even the vaguest hint of the moralising that often peppers this genre. They say that, aerodynamically, a bee ought never to be able to fly: well I think that could be said of almost all of the critters here as they dart about menacingly and colourfully for a couple of hours of what is really good fun. It’s well worth a cinema outing as the whole thing looks and sounds great on a big screen and dare I say it, I might quite like a sequel if they can keep the standard of storytelling up to that of the imagery.",whatever happened brenton thwaites reason crossed mind thoroughly entertaining fantasy adventure gets rollicking start keeps going hagar esque viking chief gerard butler expecting son take fearless dragon chaser would call hiccup might well call buttercup anyway hapless lad mason thames maybe adept muscle front cerebrally something leonardo da vinci determines set devising weapon tackle formidable foes night fury well would believe contraption actually works instead slaying thing young man decides decades combat species accomplished nothing decides bit co operation might order instead course fairly clandestine dad go ape finds fellow competitive student astrid nico parker terrible crush might decide take axe new friend slight modifications animation otherwise largely sticks story lovely hammy effort butler enjoyably mischievous one multi appendage sidekick gobber nick frost two solid performances leads thames really steals show amongst humans cheeky personable effort must quite task spent much filming dangling front green screen visuals great combination dragons galore huge scale pyrotechnics loads imagination immerses story family friendship without even vaguest hint moralising often peppers genre say aerodynamically bee ought never able fly well think could said almost critters dart menacingly colourfully couple hours really good fun well worth cinema outing whole thing looks sounds great big screen dare say might quite like sequel keep standard storytelling imagery,Negative
M3GAN 2.0,Action,"Is it really only two years since we first met M3GAN? Shouldn’t she have an ‘h’ in her name? Maybe I’m thinking of another robotic and plastic manifestation of womanhood? Anyway, this sees “Gemma” (Allison Williams) and her pals caught up with investment problems whilst Uncle Sam’s latest AI specimen “Amelia” (Ivanna Sakhno) goes off the rails. Pretty swiftly, thanks to the intervention of the newly mobile tech gazillionaire “Alt” (Jermaine Clement), she finds herself working on something she’d vowed never to touch again, else niece “Cady” (Violet McGraw) is gonna be toast. Luckily, she can count on the help of the benevolent “Christian” (Aristotle Athari) and a supply of kit that could build a space shuttle from scratch. Of course we, watching, all know this is bound to be but a cunning ploy by the demonic robot to reincarnate and cause havoc, and so down the predictably latex brick road we go. Now it’s not actually that much worse than the first film. There are some pithy lines contained amidst the endless dialogue and there are even a few laughs to be had as the acrobatics see furniture trashed and limbs torn asunder with the reliability of a “John Wick” film.

Superman,Action,"Just a fun time watching this iteration of Superman. David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan were absolutely wonderful together and Nicholas Hoult played a great Lex Luthor. Not perfect by any means, but a solid start to the DCU. This was a delightful time with crowd-pleasing moments.

Superman,Action,"Well, I enjoyed it. 

The writing felt a bit all over the place but most of the jokes were on point, the action was very enjoyable, and I think giving Superman a more classic comic feel and less of the apocalyptic Snyder vibe was a good change.

Everyone here does a great job with the acting. Lois and Jimmy are, in my opinion, the standouts. Nicholas Hoult wasn't a great choice for Luthor, with his more manic energy. Personally, I enjoyed Hackman or Cryer's cold, cunning version more. 

And, y'all, Krypto is in it. Finally we got a dog!

TLDR: It's good but not great. With that said, I still think you'll have a great time watching it. Also, DEFINITELY SEE IT IN 3D.



***SPOILERS BELOW***

I have two complaints. 

They give us two of Superman's coolest villains: Lex Luthor and Bizarro, but lame versions of both. I was expecting something on par with Iron Man vs Ironmonger circa 2008, but Lex never dons his suit. I was pretty sure the masked villain was Bizarro, and later he's revealed to be, but it would have been so much better if the authentic version had been written in.",well enjoyed writing felt bit place jokes point action enjoyable think giving superman classic comic feel less apocalyptic snyder vibe good change everyone great job acting lois jimmy opinion standouts nicholas hoult great choice luthor manic energy personally enjoyed hackman cryer cold cunning version krypto finally got dog tldr good great said still think great time watching also definitely see spoilers two complaints give us two superman coolest villains lex luthor bizarro lame versions expecting something par iron man vs ironmonger circa lex never dons suit pretty sure masked villain bizarro later revealed would much better authentic version written,Negative
Superman,Action,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/superman-review-james-gunn-gives-the-man-of-steel-a-soul/

""Superman isn't perfect. It struggles with pacing, has too many characters, and offers some clunky narrative solutions. But as the official cinematic introduction to the new DCU, it succeeds where it matters most: establishing the central pillars of the saga, giving us a worthy protagonist, and showcasing a filmmaker with a clear vision.

David Corenswet is the Superman this generation needs: a symbol of kindness, hope, and - above all - conviction-led action. Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult round out a high-quality central trio, and even with its flaws, it's hard not to leave the theater satisfied.

James Gunn delivers a clear statement of intent: DC's future is in good hands. Bring on the rest of Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. If this is the path forward, maybe - finally - DC can fly as high as its greatest hero.""

Superman,Action,"Considerable chatter has been devoted in recent years to the question of whether the movie industry is producing too many superhero/action-adventure films. Much of that talk has specifically focused on whether certain franchises/mythologies have been overdone. That’s particularly true where the “Superman” mythos is concerned, a body of work that has assumed multiple forms on TV and the big screen since the 1970s. And, after viewing this latest iteration involving this storied and much beloved character, I can’t help but concur with the opinion that the man from the planet Krypton needs to be given a serious rest for a while. In my opinion, what has been called the biggest disappointment of this summer’s blockbuster season is an assessment that’s, unfortunately, right on target. In short, writer-director James Gunn’s latest is a hot mess that strains viewer interest not long into its overlong 2:09:00 runtime (a duration that honestly feels even longer than the official tally) and never manages to get it back. The biggest problem here rests with an overstuffed narrative that at times becomes challenging to follow, thanks to a screenplay that’s loaded with incongruities, rampant assumptions and a noticeable lack of back story; film editing tediously in need of much-needed snipping; overreliance on comic relief that grows progressively tiresome (especially with Superman’s annoyingly overzealous canine pal, Krypto); and an overall production whose vision is both tedious and not particularly original (especially in the rather ho-hum action sequences that we’ve seen so many, many times before in better films, most notably those from the Marvel Universe). In addition, the picture’s attempts at updating the nature of the Superman mythology for the present day are uneven at best, including some elements that are sufficiently contemporary with others that are woefully anachronistic (e.g., why are elements involving The Daily Planet newspaper portrayed in much the same way as they were in the past, given that today’s journalism business is a very different animal from what it was years ago?). To its credit, the film’s attempts at evolving the protagonist’s character into a paragon of “wokeness” (a source of much criticism in some circles) provides an intriguing spin on the nature of the Man of Steel – one very much in line with Superman’s traditional embodiment as a champion of “truth, justice and the American way” – even if it is somewhat excessive on occasion. That’s especially true where matters involving “aliens” (like Kal El himself) are symbolically demonized as threats to society, a less-than-subtle allusion to how many perceive today’s immigrants. However, the attempt at making the film’s hero more socially relevant is at times undermined by inconsistent character development, a problem that plagues many of this release’s other players, too. And that’s unfortunate in light of the performances on display, including a capable Christopher Reeve-esque portrayal by the film’s lead (David Corenswet), as well as fine supporting characterizations of mythology staples Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) and Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult). In essence, though, “Superman” regrettably feels like an offering created by committee, a production that desperately should have gone through several more rounds of revisions before being committed to a final print. What’s more, if this picture was meant to lead off a new franchise involving this character, it comes up short all around, a prospect that doesn’t bode particularly well for the artistic future of this series. Superman deserves better than this, but that’s noticeably lacking in this release, one that, over time, is likely to become forgettable, particularly when measured against its superior predecessors, films that commendably and authentically depict its protagonist as a genuinely super-man.",considerable chatter devoted recent years question whether movie industry producing many superhero action adventure films much talk specifically focused whether certain franchises mythologies overdone particularly true superman mythos concerned body work assumed multiple forms tv big screen since viewing latest iteration involving storied much beloved character help concur opinion man planet krypton needs given serious rest opinion called biggest disappointment summer blockbuster season assessment unfortunately right target short writer director james gunn latest hot mess strains viewer interest long overlong runtime duration honestly feels even longer official tally never manages get back biggest problem rests overstuffed narrative times becomes challenging follow thanks screenplay loaded incongruities rampant assumptions noticeable lack back story film editing tediously need much needed snipping overreliance comic relief grows progressively tiresome especially superman annoyingly overzealous canine pal krypto overall production whose vision tedious particularly original especially rather ho hum action sequences seen many many times better films notably marvel universe addition picture attempts updating nature superman mythology present day uneven best including elements sufficiently contemporary others woefully anachronistic e g elements involving daily planet newspaper portrayed much way past given today journalism business different animal years ago credit film attempts evolving protagonist character paragon wokeness source much criticism circles provides intriguing spin nature man steel one much line superman traditional embodiment champion truth justice american way even somewhat excessive occasion especially true matters involving aliens like kal el symbolically demonized threats society less subtle allusion many perceive today immigrants however attempt making film hero socially relevant times undermined inconsistent character development problem plagues many release players unfortunate light performances display including capable christopher reeve esque portrayal film lead david corenswet well fine supporting characterizations mythology staples lois lane rachel brosnahan lex luthor nicholas hoult essence though superman regrettably feels like offering created committee production desperately gone several rounds revisions committed final print picture meant lead new franchise involving character comes short around prospect bode particularly well artistic future series superman deserves better noticeably lacking release one time likely become forgettable particularly measured superior predecessors films commendably authentically depict protagonist genuinely super man,Negative
Superman,Action,"First of all i would like to say that this isnt a bad movie by any means. In fact there's actually a lot to enjoy here and is easily the BEST live-action Superman movie since the Christopher Reeve era.

Corenswet as Superman/Clark is fucking amazing and the characterization of Supes would've been perfect if it weren't for that one plot twist (more on that later). I also like that thay made a point but its more on his ACTIONS that define who you are. Hoult is also spectacular, you can just feel his hate and anger and those nasty little evil smirks everytime he wins against our boy in blue. Rachel Brosnahan is also fucking perfect as Lois Lane and her interactions with not only Clark but also the Justice Gang is pure comic Lois. And to top it all of, the action, score, and visual imagery are all very much comic book-esque and just straight up fucking beautiful to see. (Mr Terrific and Metamorpho are both so good and entertaining).

BUT there is one big twist here that 90% of the general audience won't care about, but as a comic fan the twist just brings this movie down from like a 8-9/10 to a 6-7/10. That twist is just that BAD atleast for someone like me who is a big big Superman comic fan.

SPOILERS FROM NOW ON:

Now for the big plot twist. Making the House of El (Jor El and Lara) evil and Superman believing himself to be more human than alien was a really really bad choice. As i mentioned before, i know that the whole point is that Kal or Superman or Clark is more defined by his ACTIONS rather than his heritage. But to make them completely evil and have clark reject his heritage at the end (completely replacing his krypton parents with footage from his earth parents) just really sucks.

FIRST OF ALL the decision to make them evil just ruins the immigrant allegory. If you've read the comics you would know that Clark is a deeply lonely guy. Having to grow up knowing you're an alien, is different from everyone else and would constantly need to hide his powers and true self. He is afraid of being REJECTED and is the reason why he constantly yearns for his home planet krypton, a place where he could actually feel like himself and not some outsider. So to make his whole origin planet evil?? is not really helping the immigrant allegory. Like imagine if your an immigrant to the USA and suddenly in the news everyone says that your home country and everyone from there is fucking evil. STRAIGHT UP XENOPHOBIA. And to say that Clark wouldn't care about his parents and origin planet because he didnt know them is stupid. I think that Learning your father was a man who tried but failed to save a world that wouldn't listen to him would definitely have an impact on a guy who's trying to save the world everyday.

A comic issue that showcased his loneliness and fear of rejection from humans is ACTION COMICS #794 where we see Clark in his adolescence watching a film with his friends, wherein the aliens are the villains and everyone around him js cheering for the aliens to go back to their planets. Imagine the pain and loneliness you would feel knowing that everyone around you even your friends just want you to go the fuck away.

Also this is exactly why his origin needs to be truly adapted because thats where his character, morality, and such really shine. It's not only where his identity crisis and loneliness are explicitly explored but also where we see that it is not only his actions that define him but also the synthesis of all his experiences juggling his alien and human side. It also adds layers to his eventual rivalry with Lex, and shows his relationship with other super powered beings like the Legion.

In relation to that, this is also why SUPERBOY is important to be shown/adapated because its with his heroics as a teen that led to him meeting other heroes mainly the Legion of Superheroes. His adventures with the Legion is where he truly finds who he is, because like him they're also teens going through the same problems. With the legion he finally got a community where he doesn't have to hide anything, can share his problems that no other human can get and most importantly feel less LONELY and feel VALIDATED knowing that a future where superpowered beings are accepted actually exist.

(Also quick side note, this is also why him dating and losing his virginity to mermaid Lori Lemaris is so important to me. Sex and Intimacy is often done with someone you can be vulnerable with, and a mermaid or another kryptonian Lyra Lerrol be his first time is just so fitting. ADAPT SUPERBOY AND LORI PLEASE)

Him yearning for his kryptonian heritage also doesnt make him less human. Because why else would he still choose and create his secret identity/persona Clark Kent if he wants to reject it. Clark is his own guilty little pleasure of living as a human because even if he is an alien it shows that he still enjoys earth and cherishes humanity and its culture. He is supposed to be the BEST of both worlds and having him be one sided makes him a FAR LESS interesting character.

Again im going to reiterate this making him more human just removes too much LAYERS.

Another reason why his origin needs to be adapted is his relationship with Lex Luthor. In Smallville and other iconic comics such as Birthright, Secret Origin, and most recently Last Days of Lex. In these stories a young clark is often shown to have a brief childhood friendship with Lex. Like Clark, Lex always felt alone as a child. He was a science nut and was always interested in the larger universe of extra terrestrials and the like. People constantly saw and bullied him as a weird freak, and everytime he tried to help others people would just reject him. Clark was the only one who tolerated and protected him leading to their ""friendship""
But Lex's obsession with the larger universe led to his failed experiment and eventual downfall. He tried to create a machine to find and/or communicate with extra terrestrial life but it exploded and almost killed a ton of people. This led to further rejection from the people of Smallville and made him think that people would always see him as a freak just because he thought bigger and wanted to create science for a better tomorrow. This rejection then of course made him angry, resentful, and didnt care who he stepped on as long as he got his way.

And Clark feels guilty, because if Clark just told him who he really was then maybe Lex wouldn't have turned out evil. If Lex just had a friend who not only matched his intellect but also understood his experiences of being outcasted and then maybe, just maybe both of them together could have used their powers to save and create a better tomorrow for everyone. With this context in mind the rivalry becomes more complex. Superman isnt trying to just stop Lex simply because he's evil. He's also just trying to save his friend.

There are a lot more things that i dont like in the film but this where my main points really stop. My other complaints like Jimmy not being a weird lovable dork enough (he's just too regular) and most of the Daily Planet just being caricatures of their comic selves and Clark just having one scene are all really minor nitpicks that can be solved with future movies and adventures.

But again as i said in the beginning despite all my long ass complaints there's still a lot to enjoy in this film. And i cannot deny that there is clearly heart in here and is easily still the best Supes movie since Christopher Reeve. It's just the Evil Els that really ruined it for me.

LASTLY Kara having a cameo at the end kinda breaks the movie in half. Like bro, if you really think the El's are evil then why do you still like your cousin? why do you still wear the House of El logo? like bro your cousin is a living example of the footage being straight up wrong lol.

Look, it may look like im a hater right now but i genuinely just wanted to love this movie. There are so much scenes here that made the comic book fan in me just smile and cheer like crazy. But the flaws were just way too big for me and it really muddled my experience. I just want Superman, my favorite comic character of all time to be adapted well. And yes while this is definitely the best Adaptation since 1978, it just didn't hit for me. If you're a comic fan or just a movie fan in general im sure you'll still find enjoyment in this because the whole movie is still very fuckin endearing and action packed. But yeah for now, im sticking to the comics. Peace.",first would like say isnt bad movie means fact actually lot enjoy easily best live action superman movie since christopher reeve era corenswet superman clark fucking amazing characterization supes would perfect one plot twist later also like thay made point actions define hoult also spectacular feel hate anger nasty little evil smirks everytime wins boy blue rachel brosnahan also fucking perfect lois lane interactions clark also justice gang pure comic lois top action score visual imagery much comic book esque straight fucking beautiful see mr terrific metamorpho good entertaining one big twist general audience care comic fan twist brings movie like twist bad atleast someone like big big superman comic fan spoilers big plot twist making house el jor el lara evil superman believing human alien really really bad choice mentioned know whole point kal superman clark defined actions rather heritage make completely evil clark reject heritage end completely replacing krypton parents footage earth parents really sucks first decision make evil ruins immigrant allegory read comics would know clark deeply lonely guy grow knowing alien different everyone else would constantly need hide powers true self afraid rejected reason constantly yearns home planet krypton place could actually feel like outsider make whole origin planet evil really helping immigrant allegory like imagine immigrant usa suddenly news everyone says home country everyone fucking evil straight xenophobia say clark care parents origin planet didnt know stupid think learning father man tried failed save world listen would definitely impact guy trying save world everyday comic issue showcased loneliness fear rejection humans action comics see clark adolescence watching film friends wherein aliens villains everyone around js cheering aliens go back planets imagine pain loneliness would feel knowing everyone around even friends want go fuck away also exactly origin needs truly adapted thats character morality really shine identity crisis loneliness explicitly explored also see actions define also synthesis experiences juggling alien human side also adds layers eventual rivalry lex shows relationship super powered beings like legion relation also superboy important shown adapated heroics teen led meeting heroes mainly legion superheroes adventures legion truly finds like also teens going problems legion finally got community hide anything share problems human get importantly feel less lonely feel validated knowing future superpowered beings accepted actually exist also quick side note also dating losing virginity mermaid lori lemaris important sex intimacy often done someone vulnerable mermaid another kryptonian lyra lerrol first time fitting adapt superboy lori please yearning kryptonian heritage also doesnt make less human else would still choose create secret identity persona clark kent wants reject clark guilty little pleasure living human even alien shows still enjoys earth cherishes humanity culture supposed best worlds one sided makes far less interesting character im going reiterate making human removes much layers another reason origin needs adapted relationship lex luthor smallville iconic comics birthright secret origin recently last days lex stories young clark often shown brief childhood friendship lex like clark lex always felt alone child science nut always interested larger universe extra terrestrials like people constantly saw bullied weird freak everytime tried help others people would reject clark one tolerated protected leading

Superman,Action,"<em>'Superman'</em> is the best Supes film that I've seen - and I highly enjoyed 2013's <em>'Man of Steel'</em>, so that is actually saying something. I was surprised at how great this 2025 edition is, like at no point was I ever doubting what I was seeing - it's a fab 2hrs.

I had seen snippets from a few trailers for this and, in truth, wasn't really vibing with it back then. The lead actor seemed a bit underwhelming, the dialogue felt lousy and Lex Luthor came across over the top. I'm pleased to say, none of those things are true.

David Corenswet is an ace Superman, he fits the role to perfection. Again, I did like Henry Cavill's stint as the eponymous Kryptonian, though I do reckon Corenswet does ever so slightly outdo him. It's silly of me to even compare to be honest, given my appreciation for both.

For me, Nicholas Hoult is just as big a plus. This is the best of him I've seen, given I've never been fully convinced. Don't get me wrong, I've liked performances from him, but almost always with an asterisk of sorts attached in my mind. No such issues here, he is fantastic as Lex.

Rachel Brosnahan and Edi Gathegi also dazzle, the latter's character is especially interesting as I never knew he existed before this - hope to see more! Anthony Carrigan, Nathan Fillion and Isabela Merced also manage to stick out, which is impressive. All those onsceen are good.

The story is a surpremely entertaining one. I like how they skipped over the origins of Superman, the vast majority of viewers already know the backstory so it's not needed - and for those that don't, a simple short overview, as seen here, is more than enough to get the point across.

As for everthing else? The pacing, the visuals, the special effects, the music... all excellent. I, somewhat unexpectedly, have zero issues with this one, I thoroughly had fun with it and would happily revisit it at any time.",em superman em best supes film seen highly enjoyed em man steel em actually saying something surprised great edition like point ever doubting seeing fab hrs seen snippets trailers truth really vibing back lead actor seemed bit underwhelming dialogue felt lousy lex luthor came across top pleased say none things true david corenswet ace superman fits role perfection like henry cavill stint eponymous kryptonian though reckon corenswet ever slightly outdo silly even compare honest given appreciation nicholas hoult big plus best seen given never fully convinced get wrong liked performances almost always asterisk sorts attached mind issues fantastic lex rachel brosnahan edi gathegi also dazzle latter character especially interesting never knew existed hope see anthony carrigan nathan fillion isabela merced also manage stick impressive onsceen good story surpremely entertaining one like skipped origins superman vast majority viewers already know backstory needed simple short overview seen enough get point across everthing else pacing visuals special effects music excellent somewhat unexpectedly zero issues one thoroughly fun would happily revisit time,Negative
Superman,Action,"Putting all else aside, James Gunn's ""Superman"" succeed's because it adopts, an all too familiar, wholly ""likeable"", approach.

This film borrows heavily from the 70's Superman franchise. Its look, its feel, right down to costumes, harks back to that era. As does, the very simple, down to earth main character, capably played by  David Corenswet. I personally, could not but recall Christoper Reeve, in his performance.

This is Superman as he was mean't to be. No cynicism, no divisive woke politics, just a good guy doing his best. Its this innately appealing character and those around him, that make this film function. Because lets be honest, whilst its an entertaining romp, the script is, in my estimation ""chaotic"". Its literally all over the place, doing too many things at once. That said, if you view those scenes in isolation, a good portion, are both enjoyable and amusing. For example, Lex Luthor, getting his comeuppance, from Superman's cousins, kooky Superdog. 

In summary, no ""Superman"" 2025 is not a perfect film. That said, in a world that's become cynical and divisive, the simple, honest, likeability of this film shines though in a way that's impossible to ignore. For my money, well worth a look.",putting else aside james gunn superman succeed adopts familiar wholly likeable approach film borrows heavily superman franchise look feel right costumes harks back era simple earth main character capably played david corenswet personally could recall christoper reeve performance superman mean cynicism divisive woke politics good guy best innately appealing character around make film function lets honest whilst entertaining romp script estimation chaotic literally place many things said view scenes isolation good portion enjoyable amusing example lex luthor getting comeuppance superman cousins kooky superdog summary superman perfect film said world become cynical divisive simple honest likeability film shines though way impossible ignore money well worth look,Negative
Superman,Action,"I know I’m swimming against the tide here, but I just didn’t really rate this. I suppose it was only a matter of time before “Superman” got dragged (literally) into the multiverse. This time it is the DC one that’s being used by the evil “Lex Luthor” (Nicholas Hoult) who has quite a grudge against our red-caped hero. That’s because “Soop” (David Corensweet) recently intervened in a war to assist a small agrarian nation from being invaded by it’s nasty militarised neighbour. With access to his enormous resources, “Luthor” manages to penetrate the secret Antarctic fortress of our well-meaning protector to find not only his deepest secrets but also to kidnap his energetic dog “Krypto” - thus luring his quarry into the aforementioned “pocket universe” where the ultimate super-max prison contains many whom the planet doesn’t know what do do with any more, and a few ex-girlfriends. What chance he can escape through a complex sequence of portals (think “Stargate”)? Well that is largely down to his tenacious on/off girlfriend “Lois” (Rachel Brosnahan) who is entirely aware of her beau’s double identity, and to a tech whizz (Edi Gathegi) from another group of meta humans called the “Justice Gang” run by the “Green Lantern” who occasionally help out when the relentless stream of aliens descend on Metropolis. Now the scene is set for a really weak, repetitious and entirely derivative series of thwack and pow adventures that had me looking at the ceiling just once too often. Gene Hackman was always going to take some beating as “Luthor” but why use a British actor at all, and then make him use an entirely unnecessary American accent before giving him lines that make him sound like a frenzied bingo-caller? What’s with the dog? Aw, bless, but really? It just goes to show how remarkably ordinary “Superman” has become in a world so completely dominated by technology and people with far greater superpowers. Corensweet tries quite hard, is easy on the eye and he has some charm to him, but nobody else really has enough to get their teeth into and just by shaving Hoult’s head you don’t make him menacing. He isn’t in the least. There is cheesy sentiment all over this CGI-fest of a film that has a passing similarity to Ezra Miller’s “The Flash” from 2023. Sure, it moves along quickly but when you start to create cracks in what made a superhero super in the first place, you have to be able to infill with some serious attempts at action characterisation - not slushy dog-loving, baby/girlfriend-saving ones. No such development happens here and after the final denouement - there are a few goes at that - I left the cinema thinking this was an huge victory for style over substance and that this fella isn’t so much super as flawed: physically and emotionally.

Karate Kid: Legends,Action,"The marketing around this has been terrible, I thought, so I was not really expecting much - but it’s not so very bad after all. That’s almost entirely down to a cheeky and engaging effort from Ben Wang as the young “Li Fong” who has recently (and reluctantly) arrived in Los Angeles from Beijing with his doctor mother (Ming-Na Wen) after a family tragedy which we go into a little more, later. He befriends pizza family “Victor” (Joshua Jackson) and his teenage daughter “Mia” (Sadie Stanley) but quickly - and quite brutally - discovers that former prize-fighting dad is in hock to a loan shark and so wants to try to punch his way out of his problems. When he realises that the young lad has some skill with kung-fu, they decide to team up and that’s the start of their escapades that ultimately pitches the new arrival against local champion “Conor” (Aramis Knight). For that challenge, he is lucky to have the help of his visiting Chinese mentor “Shifu” (Jackie Chan) who manages to elicit the assistance of the original “Karate Kid” himself (Ralph Macchio) so he may practise the more cerebral “Miyagi” form of karate. Predictable? Well, yes and Macchio is about as wooden as one of his late, lamented, master’s bonsai trees but there’s a little gentle mischief from Chan and just about enough action to stop the melodrama from swamping the thing. You will probably never recall it half an hour after you’ve seen it, but it’s is probably second to the original (1984) and passes a couple of hours effortlessly.",marketing around terrible thought really expecting much bad almost entirely cheeky engaging effort ben wang young li fong recently reluctantly arrived los angeles beijing doctor mother ming na wen family tragedy go little later befriends pizza family victor joshua jackson teenage daughter mia sadie stanley quickly quite brutally discovers former prize fighting dad hock loan shark wants try punch way problems realises young lad skill kung fu decide team start escapades ultimately pitches new arrival local champion conor aramis knight challenge lucky help visiting chinese mentor shifu jackie chan manages elicit assistance original karate kid ralph macchio may practise cerebral miyagi form karate predictable well yes macchio wooden one late lamented master bonsai trees little gentle mischief chan enough action stop melodrama swamping thing probably never recall half hour seen probably second original passes couple hours effortlessly,Positive

I didn’t like this. That said, my only frame of reference for The Karate Kid is that one How I Met Your Mother episode, so I haven’t seen the original films. But because I know how much people hype this franchise and how beloved it is, I went in expecting a lot. I expected phenomenal karate choreography, some intense emotional moments, and real substance.
Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I don’t think I’m the target audience for this film, honestly, it didn’t feel like it was made for me, which is absolutely fine. It lacked depth, it didn’t have the emotional or narrative weight I was hoping for, and the overall vibe just didn’t land with me. The Karate Kid: Legends wasn’t for me.

Karate Kid: Legends,Action,"The «Karate Kid: Legends» (2025) tries to carry the legacy of the original trilogy—«The Karate Kid» (1984), Part II (1986), and Part III (1989)—but it doesn not quite land.

Something about it feels off. The heart that made the original films memorable is hard to find here. It is not just nostalgia—it is the way those earlier stories balanced conflict discipline, and standing for what is right. This version feels like a toned down version. It is not strong enough to stand beside the classics either.

It is not the cast. They are fine. It is the story that lacks the weight and soul to live up to what «The Karate Kid» once meant. And as much as it wants to honour Mr. Miyagi, it does not quite reach that level of tribute.

""Bride Hard is a waste of time and talent. With a disastrous script, uninspired performances (save for rare exceptions), and direction devoid of energy, the movie fails in nearly every fundamental area.

Its attempt to mix action, comedy, and a story about female friendship feels like a formula we've seen dozens of times - and almost always done better. Aside from the occasional effective laugh, nothing about this project justifies a trip to the theater.

Ballerina,Action,"This isn’t a film, it’s a live action video game with a predictable plot and loads of energetically choreographed CGI to substitute for anything vaguely akin to a story. It starts with the young “Eve” (Victoria Comte) who witnesses her father’s death at the hands of “The Chancellor” (Gabriel Byrne) before being adopted into the secret society of “John Wick” by “Winston” (Ian McShane) and his drag-like boss (Angelica Huston) where she learns to combine the artistic skills of a ballerina with deadly ninja ones - as she morphs into Ana de Armas (whilst everyone else remains exactly the same). Anyway, none of that really matters as she accidentally discovers the identity of the tribe who ruined her life and despite warnings of dire consequences, sets off on a lethal mission of retribution that takes her to a Czech Republic where everyone speaks perfect English. The thing is, it appears that her gang and the one she is pursuing have a sort of unwritten truce, and given she is about to throw that under the Skoda, Angelica has no choice other than to bring out of retirement the legendary you know who. Will that make anything any different or safer or even less repetitive? It not so much that this is derivative and really quite dull, it’s that the dialogue is woeful and the constant frying pan to fire scenarios where people get used and abused are ridiculous. Knives, guns, bottles, pots, pans, kettles - even a pair of ruthlessly applied roller skates and some flamer throwers help our heroine along but it’s hilarious that they always appear just when she needs them. She’s got the points and gone up a level, She also heals as if she were the sister of “Wolverine” and no amount of training is going to remove a six inch shard of glass from your body without it impeding your ability to scale a wall and wield a pick axe. Maybe I just wasn’t in the mood, but just like the series upon which this is based, it is unoriginal and after the umpteenth time she has survived against innumerable odds to fight again just had me wondering how long until she’s back with “Ballerina II - the Pirouette”.

Ballerina,Action,"_Ballerina_ is a culmination of everything that works in the John Wick universe, but also dialed up to new heights. The movie is quite a simple vengeance story at the center which is sadly left unfulfilled but it is how well every other element of the movie is taken that makes this story actually work at the end of the day. The action is the same John Wick action we know and love but with so much more creativity infused this time around, from people popping like a balloon by way of grenade to people being lit on fire like crazy. This different approach to the action of the main John Wick films, which is often cold and very mechanical, makes Ballerina stand out on its own. Of course, _Ballerina_ also stands out because of the committed efforts of Ana de Armas as Eve who the audience actually gets to care for in the movie. That's why John Wick's inclusion here seems like a massive 4th wall break because the audience is locked into Eve and her vengeful mission. Other flaws of this movie lie in character development, balance, motivation, and redemption but also in short plot points and vague plot points. Lastly, the world building in _Ballerina_ is a healthy amount, especially for a spin-off film, making the movie that much more interesting. _Ballerina_ is another stellar addition to the John Wick universe that I hope has legs to continue in the future.",ballerina culmination everything works john wick universe also dialed new heights movie quite simple vengeance story center sadly left unfulfilled well every element movie taken makes story actually work end day action john wick action know love much creativity infused time around people popping like balloon way grenade people lit fire like crazy different approach action main john wick films often cold mechanical makes ballerina stand course ballerina also stands committed efforts ana de armas eve audience actually gets care movie john wick inclusion seems like massive th wall break audience locked eve vengeful mission flaws movie lie character development balance motivation redemption also short plot points vague plot points lastly world building ballerina healthy amount especially spin film making movie much interesting ballerina another stellar addition john wick universe hope legs continue future,Positive

""Jurassic World Rebirth ends up reflecting the franchise's current state. A visually competent product, with talent in front of and behind the camera, but lost in its lack of purpose and narrative ambition.

The cast is excellent, but the characters are hollow. The dinosaurs are still impressive, but their presence no longer holds the same weight. And the themes - once so rich and provocative - have been replaced by modern dilemmas that, while valid, don't truly belong in this universe.

Maybe it's time to accept that life does, indeed, find a way - but that way isn't always through continuation. Sometimes, the best thing we can do… is let go.""

Jurassic World Rebirth,Action,"Sometimes movies have a way of surprising us in unexpectedly pleasant ways. And this latest installment in the “Jurassic” franchise is just such a case. Admittedly, I had more than a few reservations going into this one; I couldn’t help but think that this was a cinematic commodity that had run its course, that it was essentially out of gas to offer anything new of genuine value, and, to a certain degree, that’s true, at least where originality is concerned. However, despite the picture’s expected plunge into familiar territory, director Gareth Edwards’s latest feature offering is nevertheless highly entertaining, even if not particularly groundbreaking. Perhaps that rests with the fact that this is arguably the most Spielbergian installment in the series, in many ways reflective of the iconic production that launched the franchise in 1993. In yet another story involving self-serving agenda-driven characters placing themselves in tremendous peril by venturing into a world of dangerous, genetically manipulated dinosaurs recklessly brought back to life for profit and entertainment purposes, the film follows a narrative formula that most viewers will find more than a little recognizable. But what helps to set this installment apart from many of its predecessors is the quality of the filmmaking itself, specifically its ability to effectively build and maintain tension, its capacity for presenting story arc elements in fresh and inventive ways, and its overall production values, most notably its fine (and occasionally unanticipated) special effects and its efforts in upping the talent quotient of the cast with such commendable additions as Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali. Most importantly, though, this offering is to be applauded for its continuity in staying on track in terms of tone, self-aware of what kind of a movie it truly wants to be. This differentiates “Rebirth” from many of its previous releases, which often couldn’t decide whether they wanted to tell bona fide sci-fi-based tales or present themselves as campy romps (as seen, for example, in the now-famous (or is it infamous?) Bryce Dallas Howard high heel sequences in the first “Jurassic World” offering (2015)). What’s more, Spielberg’s influence in bringing this production to life is clearly present in the finished product, both in terms of honoring the merits of the series’ premiere installment, as well as in its respectful homages to the auteur’s classic 1975 offering, “Jaws.” To be sure, there are some aspects here that are wholly predictable (such as little doubt as to which characters will be offed and when), and there are times when the pacing could stand to be brisker, particularly when the film strives (sometimes a little too hard) to invoke a greater degree of character depth and development than what has typically been the case in previous “Jurassic” releases. In addition, the picture suffers from occasional plot holes, several contrived narrative devices (including one egregiously silly element near the film’s outset that nearly cost me my hopes for the remainder of the release) and more than a little blatantly shameless product placement shots. On balance, though, this is a surprisingly good picture in a series that’s now seven installments deep, an accomplishment that few franchises (other than the “Star Trek” and “007” series) can boast. Don’t be too quick to sell this one short; it may not be perfect, but it’s certainly enjoyable summertime action-adventure fare that makes for a good time on a lazy Saturday afternoon when you don’t feel like going outside to brave the heat.",sometimes movies way surprising us unexpectedly pleasant ways latest installment jurassic franchise case admittedly reservations going one help think cinematic commodity run course essentially gas offer anything new genuine value certain degree true least originality concerned however despite picture expected plunge familiar territory director gareth edwards latest feature offering nevertheless highly entertaining even particularly groundbreaking perhaps rests fact arguably spielbergian installment series many ways reflective iconic production launched franchise yet another story involving self serving agenda driven characters placing tremendous peril venturing world dangerous genetically manipulated dinosaurs recklessly brought back life profit entertainment purposes film follows narrative formula viewers find little recognizable helps set installment apart many predecessors quality filmmaking specifically ability effectively build maintain tension capacity presenting story arc elements fresh inventive ways overall production values notably fine occasionally unanticipated special effects efforts upping talent quotient cast commendable additions scarlett johansson mahershala ali importantly though offering applauded continuity staying track terms tone self aware kind movie truly wants differentiates rebirth many previous releases often decide whether wanted tell bona fide sci fi based tales present campy romps seen example famous infamous bryce dallas howard high heel sequences first jurassic world offering spielberg influence bringing production life clearly present finished product terms honoring merits series premiere installment well respectful homages auteur classic offering jaws sure aspects wholly predictable little doubt characters offed times pacing could stand brisker particularly film strives sometimes little hard invoke greater degree character depth development typically case previous jurassic releases addition picture suffers occasional plot holes several contrived narrative devices including one egregiously silly element near film outset nearly cost hopes remainder release little blatantly shameless product placement shots balance though surprisingly good picture series seven installments deep accomplishment franchises star trek series boast quick sell one short may perfect certainly enjoyable summertime action adventure fare makes good time lazy saturday afternoon feel like going outside brave heat,Negative
Jurassic World Rebirth,Action,"Well at least there is one scene where huge great dinosaurs walk, accompanied by John Williams’s original theme, to remember - but otherwise this is a really disappointing video-game of a film that offers us nothing at all that the Jurassic franchise hasn’t already. By now, these great creatures have largely been taken care of by Mother Nature and have been reduced to living in small groups in equatorial zones around the world where they just want to be left alone to eat and be eaten, protected from a humanity which is “expressly” prohibited from going there. The grasping “Krebs” (Rupert Friend - Orlando Bloom must have been busy) has a plan to cure heart disease and so recruits special ops veteran “Zora” (Scarlett Johansson) to help him secure the living DNA from three of the greatest of these creatures. They wouldn’t know one if they saw one though, so have to convince the nerdy scientist “Loomis” (Jonathan Bailey) to accompany them and their local fixer “Kincaid” (Mahershala Ali) and they head deep into these deadly waters. Meantime, a family are blithely sailing from Bermuda to Cape Town, apparently unaware of the dangers posed by these Vernian monsters. They are dad, young daughter, hormonal older daughter and her bone idle boyfriend, “Xavier” (David Iacono). Boy are they in for a shock when they cross some huge great, and angry, Mosasaurus and end up with most of their boat pointing the wrong way in the water, but with “Xavier” still able to catch some rays whilst they await rescue from, well you can guess who comes, and largely what happens from here on in. For much of the movie, we have two parallel storylines to underwhelm us: the unarmed yet remarkably resilient family have to find an abandoned HQ whilst the mercenaries play a sort of level-by-level game navigating the usual island full of beasties adventures that haven’t really advanced much since it’s nearest biological cousin - “Jurassic Park III” (2001). Oddly enough, I didn’t think these visual effects were anywhere near as effective as in the originals. Maybe we are all just too used to these great animals lumbering about on land, breaching like whales at sea, or swooping and pecking relentlessly from the air? Johansson does join in enthusiastically and Jonathan Bailey really has one one of those smiles on his face that suggests he is enjoying his days in front of the green screen knowing it has to be easier than singing “Not Getting Married” on stage eight times a week - and probably better paid. The others really only make up the numbers, though, with a few characters obviously designated as dino-fodder early-on as it rehashes scenarios from just about everything from “Indian Jones” to “Harry Potter”. It might be like comparing apples and pears, but I have to say I found the current “How to Train Your Dragon” a much more enjoyable adventure about man’s relationship with thick-skinned, scaly, predators, because this entirely forgettable film will do little more than slot nicely into the Christmas television schedules with little, if anything, to distinguish about it once it’s grand scale cinema run has concluded.

KPop Demon Hunters,Action,"I enjoyed this movie, but boy do I have issues with the storytelling and the glamorizing of K-pop idols' lives.

SPOILERS AHEAD:

1. Rumi was born part-demon, right? Her mother was a demon hunter and her father was a demon, which implies that not all demons are evil, right? Yes? No? We are never told how Rumi's mother died and we are never told what happened to Rumi's father, but I highly doubt that Rumi's mother was tricked into a relationship by a demon long enough to have a child.
2. All demons are supposed to be banished when the Honmoon is sealed, so how the heck is the cat and the crow still there, also, why do we even have a demon cat and crow? They're cute, but what are they? Are there ""true demons"" like Gwi-Ma, the cat and the crow, and ""enslaved demons"" like Jinu and his boy band?
3. Gwi-Ma enslaves other demons and practically tortures them with their shame for all eternity and we end the movie by permanently trapping them all in the demon realm with him? Really? Even though Jinu shows that demons can be redeemed by... showing them kindness and forgiveness?! REALLY?! Okay!

The last one is my biggest issue with the plot.

As for my issues with the representation of K-pop idols; their lives are only glamorous on the surface. K-pop idols are not born, they're made.

These kids go through hell, for lack of a better way to describe it. It's not so much an issue with the K-pop industry itself, as it's a ""cultural"" issue. Koreans push themselves and each other to the brink, and it can and does lead to suicide.

Thunderbolts*,Action,"Directed by Jake Schreier (Netflix’s Beef, Showtime’s Kidding) and written by Eric Pearson (Transformers One, Black Widow) and Joanna Calo (The Bear, Bojack Horseman), Thunderbolts* documents the emptiness surrounding Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) as she goes through the motions while working for the Ox Group led by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus).

Yelena still hasn’t recovered from Natasha/Black Widow’s death and is sick of killing people and doing villainous tasks for money. After a visit with her father figure Alexai Shostakov (David Harbour), Yelena decides to go straight and attempt to be a hero.

Unfortunately for her, de Fontaine is currently being investigated by the government and is on the verge of being impeached. Yelena’s last job is just an excuse for de Fontaine to tie up all her loose ends and appear innocent. Yelena finds herself trapped in a giant incinerator with U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), and a man plagued with memory loss named Bob (Lewis Pullman).

Thunderbolts* is a strange superhero film for a variety of reasons. The antihero dynamic already gives the film a dysfunctional Guardians of the Galaxy/Suicide Squad appeal, where a bunch of outcasts find refuge and redemption by working together as a team. But the film’s writing is interesting because Thunderbolts* doesn’t feature traditional character development. What these characters share is loss.

In a reveal that is likely not difficult to figure out, there’s more to Bob than Thunderbolts* lets on. Without fully spoiling the direction the film goes in with the character, Bob is able to see someone’s memories with physical touch. While this results in some interesting reveals from certain character’s pasts, it never really gets too deep even when Bob decides to share a bit more about what he’s gone through.

With Bob’s ability to enter people’s minds at will, the finale of Thunderbolts* has an Inception kind of element to it, but is more of a battle with inner demons than it is an all out CGI slugfest. The Thunderbolts* crash through dream barriers that alter physics while transitioning to whichever character is taking the lead in the sequence (the film typically goes back and forth between Yelena and Bob).

But the uniting of these characters still rides on trauma and loss. Yelena is searching for something to fill the emptiness inside of her. Alexei hasn’t been Red Guardian since the events of Black Widow and now drives a red limo for a job. He has completely lost whatever remained of his already dwindling super-soldier status.

Ghost no longer struggles to control her powers or her molecular status, but she does struggle with finding a purpose in this film. Apart from fighting and bickering with everyone, Ghost doesn’t add much to the film.

U.S. Agent is in denial about no longer being Captain America. He acts like he has everything going for him, but has initially lost everything after the events of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is on the verge of losing everything she’s been trying to build. Bob has always been alone. He’s never had friends and the void that has left inside him is quite literally a plot device for later in the film.

Bucky (Sebastian Stan) has been dabbling in Congress, but he’s kind of floundered around since Sam Wilson became the new Captain America. He’s not so secretly a part of the de Fontaine impeachment investigation and is searching for some sort of concrete evidence the only way The Winter Soldier can.

The film’s entertainment value is mostly invested in how unlikely this group of outcasts and shoehorned “heroes” are when they’re all trapped together in the same building. They initially start off being too stubborn to work together and it’s only once they learn how flawed the other costumed individuals are around them do they start to actually make a decent team.

There isn’t a ton of depth to Thunderbolts*, but it’s fun for what it is and is much more enjoyable than Captain America: Brave New World. The film is mostly setting up a new Avengers-like team for the next phase of the MCU although Sam Wilson’s Captain America is doing something similar. The film is purely worth seeing for Bob. The character has serious potential and Lewis Pullman has a clueless charm in his performance that coincides with one of the most powerful characters in the MCU.

Thunderbolts* is loaded with ass-kicking awesomeness. Florence Pugh is outstanding and Bob is the coolest character to come along in the MCU in a long, long time.

Thunderbolts*,Action,"Thunderbolts genuinely surprised me. I went in expecting a fun Marvel team up but got something even better: a fresh story, fantastic humor, and well-rounded characters that made it stand out in the MCU.

The Vault escape sequence was funny and memorable, capturing the chaotic spirit and humorous banter between the team. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine makes a standout villain, she was clever, cunning, and convincingly evil.

The character dynamics were great. Yelena Belova anchors the film emotionally, while Bucky Barnes feels more relatable and likeable than ever. Bob was a fun addition, bringing subtle humor and a few standout moments that added to the story's emotional beats and brought a few moments of intensity. The rest of the Thunderbolts comprising of Red Guardian, Ghost and U. S. Agent also shine, creating a team that's messy, fun, and surprisingly easy to root for.

Director Jake Schreier manages to strike a perfect balance between emotion, humor, and action, giving the film real heart amid the excitement. Although the ending was a bit unusual, it worked well. You could call the ending and the movie as a whole, bold, creative, and definitely memorable.

Overall, Thunderbolts is a highly enjoyable MCU adventure that's a bit different from the norm - in the best possible way.

""Thunderbolts* is an exceptional superhero movie precisely because it focuses on a deep exploration of human fragility. Prioritizing its broken protagonists' internal struggles over pure audiovisual spectacle shows a rare maturity in a franchise often criticized for sacrificing substance in favor of generic scale.

This bold approach allows the cast to shine - Florence Pugh especially, who firmly establishes herself as one of the MCU's core pillars. By exploring themes like depression, grief, abandonment, and reconnection with honesty and care, Jake Schreier transforms a blockbuster into a poignant meditation on shared purpose and what it means to live with open wounds.

In a landscape flooded with recycled formulas, Marvel has delivered something courageously human - making this Phase Five closing piece not only one of the year's biggest surprises but also one of the most emotionally resonant entries in the entire cinematic universe.""

Thunderbolts*,Action,"Superheroes are supposed to be special, gifted individuals, so it logically follows that movies about them should be equally special. However, as has become all too apparent in recent years, that quality has been steadily eroding in these films due to oversaturation in the cinematic marketplace, a circumstance that naturally begs the question, how special (i.e., how different or distinguished) can they really be when there are so many of them? Sadly, that's the key issue weighing down this latest release in the Marvel Universe. Even though the film serves as an introduction to a new slate of Marvel superheroes, the picture isn't particularly groundbreaking given the many similar offerings that have preceded it in this genre. Despite this film's few minor modifications to an otherwise-formulaic and shopworn narrative, in many respects, the picture's story feels like it's been cobbled together from elements in other superhero adventures. For instance, the band of heroes here consists largely of a collection of courageous misfits reminiscent of releases in the ""Suicide Squad"" franchise. Then there are the nerdy sidekicks, who feel like they've been culled from the ""Deadpool"" pictures. And the primary challenge these characters face comes from the threat of dubious weaponized technology wielded by a power-hungry leader, a scenario at the heart of films like ""X-men: Days of Future Past"" (2014) and ""Logan"" (2017). This patchwork of elements consequently makes for a plotline that frequently feels forced and somewhat disjointed yet also ultimately predictable. Its few departures from the tried and true, while modestly interesting, feel as though they've been included to silence critics as supposed evidence of the production's efforts to incorporate fresh new material. To its credit, ""Thunderbolts*"" features some genuinely funny comic relief and commendable performances by Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, though the action sequences come across as a little stale and the unimpressive CGI effects could use some shoring up. Director Jake Schreier does a capable job of doing what this film was essentially designed to do - give diehard Marvel fans another fix of what they truly crave. And that's fine as far as it goes. But, in terms of its contributions to the annals of filmdom, this is far from memorable filmmaking, especially in terms of originality.

Thunderbolts*,Action,"Hats off to Florence Pugh for injecting some charisma into this film, but otherwise I found it to be little different from the latest slew of “save the planet” Marvel adventures that follows a predictable pattern of escaping from the frying pan into the fire a few times before it culminates in a proud declaration that a new franchise has been born. It turns out that “Yelena” (Pugh) has been working for years as an assassin for the “Val” (Julia-Louise Dreyfus) whose director of the CIA seems to have been running unfettered off-the-books projects around the globe trying to impose her own brand of world order. The US Congress is breathing down her neck, now, though - so it is time to eliminate all the loose ends. Of course, that doesn’t quite go to plan and instead of disposing of the incriminating evidence, she merely galvanises an unlikely team of erstwhile employees of the agency to wreak their own vengeance. Meantime, the former “Winter Soldier” has got himself elected to the House and is now determined to work with those impeaching “Val” to bring her to book. Looks like “Buckie” (Sebastian Stan) might have to join this disparate group as it becomes clear that one of their number, the unassuming and pyjama-clad “Bob” (Lewis Pullman) might have more in common with “Brightburn” than “Superman”. What now ensues is the usual team-building exercise as they learn to trust each other, reveal secrets from their typically troubled pasts and, of course, kick some ass. David Harbour enthusiastically delivers his “Red Guardian” character, as does the very slightly menacing Pugh, but the others in the gang are all instantly forgettable and though ostensibly darker than many of its contemporaries, it still suffers from the perennial problem facing the whole MCU: they tee up these baddies with overwhelming psychological and physical prowess and yet you always know there will be sunlit uplands at the end. Stick around til the very end of the credits, though, for perhaps the most poignant part of this film.

Thunderbolts*,Action,"If you're unsure about whether or not this is another Marvel flop, I can tell you that it isn't. Everything is fantastic, from the action, to the message of mental health. I'll break it down...

Action: 10/10 - The choreography is realistic and different for each character. There are many a gun fight, with explosions out the wazoo. The best thing, there isn't a sky beam at the end.

Writing: 10/10 - Nothing feels rushed, it's well paced, and the characters appear to develop throughout the story.

Acting: 08/10 - Yelena and Bob have some of the best and most relatable dialogue, and the actors do a great job portraying the characters emotion.

Casting: 10/10 - Everyone looks like they could be their respective characters. Yelena appears as if she could have come from the Red Room. Red Guardian looks like he's still tough, but hasn't been in the action for a while. The same goes for Bucky.

Humor: 08/10 - The comedy of Red Guardian is something almost no one can surpass, which is not to say the other characters aren't funny. While sometimes their comedic timing is off, I bet you'll laugh a few times. 

Message: 10/10 - The concept of mental health is something that is constantly brought up in this movie. Yelena feels unfulfilled and is doing these jobs as a distraction, and Bob is stuck in his own darkness. The concept of heading for the light, rather than the darkness, is the main message in this movie. With that said, if you pay close attention, you'll leave, having learned something about mental health.

Thunderbolts*,Action,"<em>'Thunderbolts*'</em> - a good 36th entry for the MCU.

With that said, Florence Pugh is the clear standout in my opinion. Lewis Pullman is solid in his role, the same can be said about Sebastian Stan. I personally wanted to see more of David Harbour, he is certainly the most amusing of those that make an appearance in thsi 2025 flick.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a bit underwelming, mind you. I don't think the character is interesting enough to feature so heavily and to be quite as instrumental in the plot as de Fontaine ends up being.

""The Old Guard 2 is a mixed bag - a sequel that improves in some areas but regresses in others. Its action remains entertaining, bolstered by committed performances and sharp choreography. Thematically, it dares to ask meaningful questions about destiny, power, and morality, even if it struggles to answer them in a satisfying manner.

But a sluggish pace, tonal inconsistencies, and an overemphasis on setting up future installments dilute what could have been a sharper, more impactful story. Fans of the first film might find enough to enjoy, but it's hard to shake the feeling that this franchise is losing sight of what made it special in the first place.

Heads of State,Action,"""Heads of State"" functions as a basic ""buddy"" team up, comedy action flick but its not without its limitations.

Lets start with the positives. Idris Elba and John Cena are perfect choices for this kind of film. Ones loud, a showman, in the role of the US president. The other's more grounded and somewhat acerbic, as the UK Prime Minister. The interplay between the two works well, moving from mutual disdain, to at times grudging, respect and even friendship, of a kind. 

The action is well paced too, it keeps coming with a little mostly light drama, in between, so you can catch your breath. 

Now to the downside. They can play this any way they like but its hard not to see elements of pro US/UK political and military propaganda, in operation. NATO are heavily pushed as the ""good guys"", taking on ""bullies"". Well tell that to the former Yugoslavia NATO bombed into the ground and ultimately, destroyed. Its unsurprising too, that the ""baddies""are portrayed as Russian.

Heads of State,Action,"<em>'Heads of State'</em> holds positives and negatives, for me. For the opening half of the movie, I was not feeling it. It just all felt so plain, stale and quite grating, to be honest. To my surprise, though, it actually improved as it went on. By the end, I think it actually won me over.

One element that was keeping my interest, even amongst the aforementioned slow initial chunk, was the cast. I like Idris Elba, I like John Cena. Therefore, I had just enough in me to keep my eyes on the screen. Their banter is a bit forced, but does become effective eventually.

Priyanka Chopra is pretty good, plenty of satisfactory action from her; that recap edit is amusingly done, to be fair. Jack Quaid's bit is fun, while Paddy Considine, Stephen Root and Carla Gugino are decent actors to compensate for otherwise quite lame characters.

If not for those named, I'd be rating this a lot lower. Still, there are some strong moments and cool shots in there, like the apartment staircase and the lost tooth moment. Annoyingly, there is a fair amount wrong too; for example, the special effects are absolutely not good.

F1,Action,"There is no need to say a lot about the movie, it was very very very nice. If you don't care about F1 but just casually like any competition just give it a go. It is really hard for me to watch a longer video without doing something else too but I watched the entire length of this movie without thinking anything about doing something else or eat or touching my phone. Some more thoughts if you already watched the movie and just want to read things others say but you really should not care about: could it have been better? yes, i missed more info about certain events or characters. not much more, but just a little bit more. the ending? perfect. I expected something else then it still delivered. I don't really know how to say this but you can feel proud watching this, the entire way through the movie. There is nothing to really cringe about and I really appreciate this. This alone makes this movie in the top for me.

F1,Action,"With Sir Lewis Hamilton and F1 media veteran Ian Holmes amongst those at the helm of this production, you can be certain that it’s going to be as an authentic story of all things F1 (can’t be bothered finding the trademark symbol) as you’re ever likely to see. It’s all about team “Ruben” (Javier Bardem) whose cars couldn’t beat an egg and so is looking at ending up broke! His remaining driver is British rookie “Joshua” (Damson Idris) but he’s nowhere near experienced enough to make any impact on the problem. For that, he needs to coax back “Sonny” (Brad Pitt) who did drive these cars twenty years ago but hung up his helmet after an accident and then became an itinerant driver eking a living across the USA. Can he be tempted? Well we’d have no film if he wasn’t so the next question is: can he manage to salvage this operation before it’s sold for scrap? True to form with this sport, what now ensues sees all the glitz and glamour of circuits around the world; money no object cars, training and equipment; testosterone galore both in the car and with team tech director “Kate” (Kerry Condon) as well as a whole slew of rule manipulating, crashes, downright cheating and I have to say, some of the best action and in-car photography I’ve seen on a big screen. Indeed, I could cheerfully have lived without the dramatic characterisation here altogether, and just stuck to the tensely directed and really compelling action sequences that, especially using the in-car cameras, is genuinely quite exciting to watch. You really do get a sense of the speed of the cars racing round the tracks and of the phenomenal engineering that goes into the design and manufacture of these cars that at times look no more substantial than an Airfix kit. Pitt is in his element here delivering a character that’s a lovable rogue meets smug git whilst Idris comes across entirely naturally as the youngster out of his depth but willing and determined to learn. The soundtrack from the likes of Queen and Led Zeppelin livens up what I’d have to say isn’t Hans Zimmer’s most memorable score, and with the last half hour largely devoid of the romantic and emotional clutter, we watch something that shows us this circus in full pomp.

Kaiju No. 8: Mission Recon,Action,"“Kafka” had tried to join the elite Defence Force but had realised his own limitations and instead taken up a job cleaning up after them as they police a Japan frequently assaulted by deadly “Kaiju”. When his team gets a newbie, “Ishikawa”, this younger lad politely but pointedly stresses that he is aiming for more, but he understands why his new colleague “quit”! Subliminally provocative? Well as the pair start to work together, the former man starts to get a little of his mojo back and so when the Force extends it’s age limits, he decides to have another go. Meantime, his would-be colleagues are facing their biggest challenge ever as the mysterious and powerful “Kaiju No. 8” continues to evade them. Now we know a little more about that that the enforcers do, and that helps tee this story up for quite a dramatic ending that tests loyalty, trust and friendships across the board as peril ebbs ever closer and the monsters starts to acquire some distinctly zombie traits. This is a solidly executed and quickly paced adventure that spends a little time building on the characters (from a previous series) but for the most part  just engages us in an action-packed squash the baddies festival with plenty of squelching and loads of gunge and goo covering the streets as and “Kaiju” and the buildings end up collateral damage during the battles. There’s a bit of sarcasm hidden in the dialogue which I quite liked, and the messages of team playing, inter-reliance and of age not necessarily being a barrier to attaining your goals are here but not laboured. Stick around after the credits, there’s another twenty minutes or so (from the next series) that serves to humanise some of these folks, and if you’re looking for a colourfully vibrant series of shoot/slice/blow ‘em ups, then this is for you.

A Minecraft Movie,Action,"Alright, buckle up, because I just saw a movie that completely blew my mind! Seriously, I'm still buzzing. From the very first scene, I was absolutely hooked, and it didn't let go until the credits rolled.

The story? Oh my gosh, the story! It was so clever and well-crafted. It had twists and turns I never saw coming, but it all made perfect sense in the end. It was like a puzzle that slowly came together, and every piece was perfectly placed. You know when a movie makes you think? This one definitely did that. It wasn't just mindless action or fluff; it had real substance.

And the characters! They were so real and relatable. I felt like I knew them, like I was right there with them on their journey. They had depth, they had flaws, they had moments that made me laugh, and moments that made me want to cry. I was completely invested in what happened to them. The actors did an amazing job bringing them to life. You could feel their emotions through the screen.

Visually, it was stunning. The way it was shot, the colors, the sets – everything was just beautiful. It wasn't just pretty to look at, though; it also added to the story and the mood. Some scenes were so powerful, they'll stay with me for a long time. The music was also perfect! It really enhanced the emotions and made everything even more impactful.

Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,Action,"Whenever a film playing in theaters is introduced by one of the members of the picture’s creative team, it’s a safe bet that it doesn’t live up to its pre-release hype. (Indeed, in all the years I’ve watched movies theatrically, that’s been the case every time with just two exceptions.) And, regrettably, that’s very much the case in this final installment in this long-running franchise. To put it simply, “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” is an offering with a lot of problems, the biggest of which being the decision to split the story into two parts in the first place. As it stands, the narrative could have easily been condensed down to a single release. But, if the producers truly wanted to make two films to close out the franchise, they could have readily done so by making two distinct stand-alone pictures instead of trying to tie this offering to its predecessor, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One” (2023), considering that the nexus between them is tepid at best. As a consequence, though, this two-film package makes for a needlessly long 5½-hour story that could have been told in much less time with some judicious editing. This suggests that milking the box office had to have been a strong incentive for how this project ultimately played out. And, even if that wasn’t the case, the least the creators could have done was to tell a better story: While the first part did a reasonably capable job of holding viewer interest, that’s out the window here with its many well-crafted but decidedly overlong action sequences (a la the most recent “Indiana Jones” offering (2023)); a story that elevates comparatively minor characters to unexplained relevance; under-utilizes the talents of several gifted cast members (e.g., Nick Offerman and Janet McTeer) while leaving others out entirely (where’s Vanesa Kirby’s White Widow, a character who played a key role in the first part?); and requires comprehensive audience familiarity with both the franchise’s complete mythology, as well as in-depth knowledge of the intricacies of AI technology. Most importantly, however, many plot elements of the picture go beyond being “impossible” to “wholly implausible” or even “difficult to accept,” with numerous scenes that are full of holes, rely on convenient contrivances or seem completely unfathomable. “Final Reckoning” even “borrows” elements from other movie narratives (most notably “Fail Safe” (1964) and “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991)) that strain its efforts at originality. There’s also an almost self-congratulatory aspect to the production thanks to the inclusion of numerous flashback clips to previous installments in the franchise, introduced with somewhat tangential tie-ins, a cinematic stroll down memory lane that adds little (the film’s inspired reintroduction and effective use of CIA operative William Donloe (Rolf Saxon) from the franchise’s first release (1996) notwithstanding). In the end, however, this release misses the mark in myriad ways, and that even includes a rather lame conclusion that comes across as stretched out and unsatisfyingly anticlimactic (and that could have been handled better and differently in several alternate scenarios). In my view, this collection of blatant shortcomings is not the way to wrap up a storied franchise like this. I firmly believe that it should have come to an end with the release of “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” (2018), handily the best of the eight features in this series. Indeed, going to the well one (or two!) too many times can tarnish a mythology’s legacy, and “Mission: Impossible” is one such venture. It genuinely deserves to go out with a bang and not a whimper.

Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,Action,"It might have been a good idea for Tom Cruise to have re-released the first part of this career retrospective a few weeks ago so we could be reminded of just what was in the submarine perched precariously on a subterranean ridge in the Arctic - because I had totally forgotten what happened last time around. Quickly, though, we are reminded that the entity (anyone see the “Forbin Project” from 1970?) is bent on seizing control of the world’s nuclear arsenals and using them to start a process of mutually assured destruction that will eradicate all life on Earth. Luckily “Ethan” (Cruise) has the magic key that might lead to humanity’s salvation, but he also needs the support of his erstwhile bosses, the President of the USA, an aircraft carrier and a nuclear submarine that actually works. Once we have waded through all the recaps the story kicks in with plenty of opportunity for our ingenious hero and his team - largely without Ving Rhames this time - to put together a series of cunning plays and counter-plays to keep themselves ahead of not just the megalomaniacal virus but also the malevolent “Gabriel” (Esai Morales) who reckons he might be able to take control. It’s essentially a vehicle for the star for the supporting efforts from the likes of Hayley Atwell and Simon Pegg offer us little of distinction, but if you’re a fan of action adventure movies then this is the equivalent of a higher-tech “Indiana Jones” movie with car chases; loads of pyrotechnics; great visual effects, an energetic score and it culminates with an enjoyable aerial dogfight that just needed the Red Baron and/or Sir Sean Connery. I am struggling to believe this is really the last of these, but if it is then it’s a fitting denouement for a character that has largely delivered well these last thirty years and that has has come along way from the Peter Graves stuff from the late 1960s. It does need a big screen as it will look very ordinary on the television, but even though it is probably half an hour longer than it needs to be, is still a good watch.",might good idea tom cruise released first part career retrospective weeks ago could reminded submarine perched precariously subterranean ridge arctic totally forgotten happened last time around quickly though reminded entity anyone see forbin project bent seizing control world nuclear arsenals using start process mutually assured destruction eradicate life earth luckily ethan cruise magic key might lead humanity salvation also needs support erstwhile bosses president usa aircraft carrier nuclear submarine actually works waded recaps story kicks plenty opportunity ingenious hero team largely without ving rhames time put together series cunning plays counter plays keep ahead megalomaniacal virus also malevolent gabriel esai morales reckons might able take control essentially vehicle star supporting efforts likes hayley atwell simon pegg offer us little distinction fan action adventure movies equivalent higher tech indiana jones movie car chases loads pyrotechnics great visual effects energetic score culminates enjoyable aerial dogfight needed red baron sir sean connery struggling believe really last fitting denouement character largely delivered well last thirty years come along way peter graves stuff late need big screen look ordinary television even though probably half hour longer needs still good watch,Negative

Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,Action,"<em>'Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning'</em> is up there for being the most I've enjoyed a M:I movie, it's certainly in the top four anyway. It probably is a touch overlong, though I can't say I ever felt bored through the 2hrs 50mins. It's packed with action, so no surprise.

Tom Cruise is, as we've seen across the prior seven installments, excellent in the role of Ethan Hunt. Those with him here are very good, but there's no doubt Cruise is the glue. Speaking of the rest, Ving Rhames gets a nice arc, while Hannah Waddingham and Tramell Tillman have good bits.

It was never* one of my favourite franchises, but I still enjoyed every entry of <em>'Mission: Impossible'</em> to a fairly high level; fwiw, I scored every release at 8/10 - a very consistent series, evidently. Happy I (belatedly) got to see one of 'em on the big screen too.

The Amateur,Action,"<em>'The Amateur'</em> is not all that believable or unique, but it without question made for a satisfying time at the movies for me. It feels like a long while since I've seen Rami Malek in anything; fwiw, <em>'Oppenheimer'</em> over a year ago. This makes for a strong return into my world.

Malek is the beating heart of the movie, as you'd expect. I mentioned that it doesn't come across as all that plausible, though that is only in regards to what the film ends up portraying; Malek is convincing as the main dude. Elsewhere, Laurence Fishburne and Michael Stuhlbarg are good.

""The Amateur ends up being a mild disappointment, especially given the legitimate expectations raised by the talent involved, both in front of and behind the camera.

Despite a committed performance from Rami Malek, James Hawes' adaptation fails to escape a formulaic, timid, and emotionally shallow narrative - its simplicity and lack of surprise stand as its most significant flaws. There are occasional glimpses of emotional weight, but the script rarely ventures into more complex or thematically challenging territory, resulting in an experience that might entertain in the most basic sense.

For a spy thriller with introspective ambitions, its biggest misstep was settling for the surface level.""

The Amateur,Action,"“Heller” (Rami Malek) is the geeky “Jack Ryan” type, stuck in an office five floors below sunlight working on intelligence gathering and decrypting for the CIA. Intrigued by his latest set of dossiers from a deep throat somewhere on the internet, he suspects he has stumbled upon something nefarious. Before he has time to investigate, though, he hears that his wife has been the victim of a terrorist attack in London and so now he’s seeing red. Using the information he has recently obtained as leverage, he gets himself trained and equipped for an operational mission to get some revenge. Thing is, “Heller” isn’t a natural born killer, and despite the best efforts of his handler “Henderson” (Laurence Fishburne) he isn’t considered likely to be much more effective than a wet lettuce when it comes to killing anyone. What we now see is that there are more ways than one to skin a cat and brain can sometimes overcome brawn if applied with plenty of explosives, sticky tape and even the odd rogue missile. That’s perhaps the problem with this film: we’ve seen it all before - and more compellingly, too. Malek does enough but the rest of the cast really underwhelm and the set-piece action scenes come all too few and far between before an ending that really just fizzles out. James Hawes has presented us with a great looking film, packed with gadgets and gizmos, and the story also does make you realise just how big brotherly society has become with cameras apparently everywhere manipulating imagery from your shadow cast on a water-filled dustbin lid - but after a while, that all becomes a little repetitive and the plot settles into an implausible predictability.

The Amateur,Action,"I wont mix my words the only way to describe ""The Amateur"", is painfully long winded and ultimately, boring as hell. 

There are a lot of things that could have been done with what is, essentially, an action thriller. Regrettably, the overly long lead in, combined with the unreasonably timid handling, leads to a anti climatic experience, where the pay off in terms of thrills and actual action, never really arrives. 

Its by no means the casts fault. Lead actor, Rami Malek is as capable and convincing, as ever. The problem, in this reviewers opinion, is yet another case of a weak script, that needed to be thoroughly re-written.

In summary, the concepts solid but the execution is lack lustre, long winded and excessively timid.

Sinners,Action,"Set in 1932 in Clarksdale, Mississippi, Sinners takes place throughout one night in the middle of October. Sammie Moore (the feature film debut of Miles Caton) is at a crossroads in his life. He is torn between being the son of a preacher and the blues-driven nightlife where he gets to sing, play guitar, and feel alive. Sammie submerges himself in the blues seemingly having little desire to return to his family’s religious roots.

Sammie’s twin cousins Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan) have just returned home after spending seven years in Chicago. With a mobster-like reputation, the twins intend to jumpstart a new jukejoint at an old sawmill previously owned by Klan members. However, they want the grand opening to be that very night, have several arrangements to be made, and have little time to get it all done.

As dusk turns to night and the twins’ new club seems to be off to a successful grand opening, an unspeakable evil lurks on their doorstep waiting to be invited in.

Writer and director Ryan Coogler (Black Panther, Creed) was highly inspired by the works of Robert Rodriguez, so it’s no surprise that Sinners feels like a blacker and more blues-driven version of From Dusk Til Dawn. Sinners is a supernatural action horror film, but it takes its time getting to the horror. The first half of the film is like a well-written gangster film mostly driven by dialogue while introducing a cast of characters that are mostly all worthwhile and entertaining in their ways.

Smoke and Stack have two extremely different personalities with opposing fates in Sinners, which must have been incredible for Michael B. Jordan. Smoke is more serious and lethal like a soldier while Stack is more eccentric and playful in his demeanor. Smoke also wears blue while Stack wears red. The dual performances allow Jordan to dip his toes into being a hero and a villain, two different types of music, and the dark and the light.

This is a vampire film, but it’s also a film about music. Music is the most important aspect of Sinners. The film states that the power of music can heal communities and attract evil. The initial battle between those within the club and the outside dwelling vampires starts as a mostly blacks versus whites standoff but evolves into something much more elaborate.

Like all Ryan Coogler films, Sinners is extremely black-centric but the film also incorporates several different nationalities in a period when whites thought they were the only decent race. The grocery store owners are Chinese, a biracial girl follows Stack from the north back down to the south, and Remmick (Jack O’Connell), the lead vampire, is introduced being chased by Native Americans. The African aspects allow for a deeper appreciation for the film’s stellar score and put much-needed rejuvenation to the cinematic vampire.

Sinners is also a clashing of music genres with the human characters strumming on the blues side of things while the vampires and outsiders lean into Irish folk music and jig dancing. There is this jaw-dropping sequence within the wooden walls of Club Juke when Sammie finally gets to show how talented he is as a musician. It showcases all types of music, classic and contemporary, that have essentially evolved from or been inspired by gutbucket blues (blues or jazz music featuring raw emotions and a gritty, soulful sound).

Vampire folklore is toyed with in a way that is incredibly satisfying in Sinners. The concept of being invited in is something the film approaches extremely well. Music is utilized by both sides to either attempt to keep the living together and safe or to lure them outside to become part of a red-eyed, bloodthirsty pack of undead. There’s the typical lore you expect in a vampire film like trying to use garlic to fend them off and making wooden stakes to drive through their hearts.

But in other vampire films if you kill the head vampire it can either cure those that have been changed or kill all of them. Sinners takes a different route stating that each vampire has to be killed regardless on if their leader is slain. Hoodoo also plays a major part in the film. Wunmi Mosaku (His House, Deadpool & Wolverine) portrays Annie. Annie has an emotional connection to Smoke, but she also practices hoodoo, which allows her to be the voice of reason when bodies start piling up.

Sinners is one of the horniest films to come out of the first part of the year. Films have kind of shied away from showcasing nudity and sex with recent films. Everyone in Sinners is bursting with lust and when they’re not in the middle of copulating or performing cunnilingus or fellatio they’re talking about it in graphic detail.

Sinners,Action,"It’s always gratifying to see a filmmaker take a big step up in his or her career, and that’s precisely what writer-director Ryan Coogler has done in his latest offering, a project that reflects a significant jump in the depth, artistry and sophistication of his creative output. Coming on the heels of his successes in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” (2022), “Creed” (2015) and “Fruitvale Station” (2013), Coogler has hit a home run with this period piece smart horror story about identical twin brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who return to their Mississippi home in 1932 after years of working for Al Capone in Chicago, where they made huge money that they now plan to use to open their own juke joint in a converted sawmill. It’s an opportunity where they hope to make even bigger bucks while helping to promote their talented cousin, Sammie (Miles Caton), a blues musician who’s a killer guitarist and vocalist. But, as this ambitious trio launches this effort, they’re confronted with a variety of challenges, including ghosts from their past, the perils of deeply ingrained social prejudice, the dual-edged sword posed by creative and financial success, and, most menacingly, mystical forces that may be more than they’re capable of handling. These narrative components combine to tell a captivating tale about a troubled time in the country’s history, one made all the more ominous with the appearance of supernatural powers that simultaneously offer both potential promise and the prospects of tremendous evil taking root. In bringing this picture to life, the filmmaker has served up an entertaining and engaging offering, one replete with fine performances, superb production values, sharp-edged, perfectly timed comic relief, truly inventive, deftly orchestrated cinematography, and suitably restrained (graphic though not gratuitous) imagery. Admittedly, the screenplay could use some work in a few spots (most notably with tighter writing and clearer plot elaboration), but it also manages to successfully fuse the inherent nature of several genres, including drama, dark humor and smart horror, while also presenting a wealth of insights in an array of areas. Through this picture, it’s easy to see how Coogler has appreciably upped his game as a filmmaker, one that bodes well for his future in the field. It indeed represents the revelation of a talent more profound than anyone has previously recognized or properly acknowledged. “Sinners” is a work that deserves to be remembered come awards season later this year.

Sinners,Action,"<em>'Sinners'</em> is a fair load of fun. It admittedly didn't fully knock my socks off, but there isn't any doubt that it is a very good film. It's stylish with impressive music and visuals, whilst all of the acting talent give good performances. It's paced astutely too.

Michael B. Jordan is as entertaining as he usually tends to be, I do like seeing him act. The dual role is done well here, the 'split screen' is solid but my brain sillily - no matter the movie or standard of how they portray the same actor twice - simply cannot interpret the effect as seamless.

Jack O'Connell stands out behind Jordan, particularly for the moments of sing. Hailee Steinfeld and Wunmi Mosaku are the others that I took notice of too, same can be said for Delroy Lindo, Li Jun Li and Omar Miller; I oddly always think of <em>'American Pie Presents: Band Camp'</em> with the latter (I'm so sorry, Omar).

I must say, the trailers revealed too much. I tend to avoid those so assume I didn't get the full brunt of it anyway, though even so I remember catching a couple of bits that don't occur until the gritty part of the movie. It's no biggie, trailers are designed to get bums on seats after all.",em sinners em fair load fun admittedly fully knock socks doubt good film stylish impressive music visuals whilst acting talent give good performances paced astutely michael b jordan entertaining usually tends like seeing act dual role done well split screen solid brain sillily matter movie standard portray actor twice simply interpret effect seamless jack connell stands behind jordan particularly moments sing hailee steinfeld wunmi mosaku others took notice said delroy lindo li jun li omar miller oddly always think em american pie presents band camp em latter sorry omar must say trailers revealed much tend avoid assume get full brunt anyway though even remember catching couple bits occur gritty part movie biggie trailers designed get bums seats,Negative
Sinners,Action,"I don't think I liked it as much as most people seem to, and definitely not as much as the critics, but think this movie nailed about 85% of what it tried to.

The setting, music, costumes, makeup, gore, and effects were exceedingly well done. The film is well-acted (Delroy Lindo was the standout) and it was definitely worth seeing in the theatre. 

My only complaints are that the ending felt rushed, there are a couple of oddly out of place surrealist sequences, and the villain was weak. It's a fairly long film already, but I think it would have been better if we'd gotten to see another 10 minutes of the interaction between the villain and his initial pursuers, and a few flashbacks would have been helpful. 

I also think this story would have worked better as a TV series, but still, a very original and enjoyable film.

Sinners,Action,"Sinners started off similar to a gritty drama in the Deep South, every character felt so built and I was fully invested.  Then the vampire elements started twirling in. That first fade into the moon, the guitar riff, unbelievably hard Mr. Coogler. It gave a feeling I haven’t felt since watching dune 2. Oh and the scene where we go through the history and future of music, best scene of the decade maybe? That juke joint was heaven for clarksville that night, a place where people could finally let loose and forget about all their work to enjoy powerful music, rooted in their ancestry. I ascended to heaven, and I’m not coming back down.


Under here is a review I wrote in a discord server you don’t need to read it it’s pretty basic:


Sinners is the new film from Ryan Coogler, and his first fully original story. This movie just proves how awesome and competent of a director Ryan Coogler is. This movie expertly genre blends drama with horror, which all encompasses the theme of black ownership, music, and religion. 

Sinners is one of the best new movies I’ve seen this decade. The cinematography (which I luckily saw in 70mm IMAX) was so beautiful and had chills every time the frame would expand to show off a landscape, and breathtaking sunsets and sunrises. Sometimes the frame would transition from a haunting 🤫 to a beautiful moonlight which was backed by the 10/10 musical score. I will mention more later.

BTW this movie has one of the BEST SEQUENCES that will make you ASCEND IN YOUR SEAT. Jaw was dropped. It’s not even a horror sequence.

The horror elements are so well used in this movie, it’s like kissing somebody and you get a tingle everywhere when something awesome happens. Everything is so badass and goes hard. The action made me shake for the whole 3rd act, it ruled. The end got very emotional too. So so so freaking perfect. See this in a theater.

Oh yeah the score. THE GUITAR SHREDDING AT THE BEST TIMES OHOOHOHOHOOH

Sinners,Action,"Michael B. Jordan is “Smoke” and twin brother “Stack” in this classy drama of a pair who’ve lived on the wrong side of the tracks for most of their lives, but have determined to go home and try to go straight. To that end, they buy an old barn and hope to set up their own speakeasy - with only a nominal nod to prohibition - pumping to the rafters with dancing and blues music. On the way, they ally with talented musician “Sammie” (Miles Caton) and, of course, there’s a bit of baggage for the siblings as they return to a town that’s not altogether welcoming. Once home, a mixture of confidence, threats and collective charisma succeeds in assembling a crowd for their opening night. Pretty swiftly, though, that grand celebration attracts the attention of some travellers who are keen to join the party, but perhaps in true Charlie Daniels style, they have an altogether more menacing agenda. This is the cinematic equivalent of an LP, this film. It starts with one side gradually introducing us a rich collection of characters all of whom could quite plausibly have lived in Mississippi at a time when segregation was as rife as illicit booze, and the two more recently hailing from Chicago gives things a certain gangster element too. There is also a very subtly powerful effort from Hailee Steinfield as “Mary” too. The flip side of the record proceeds to develop some elements of peril with the story, and that’s where it rather runs out of steam for me. It tries very hard to create a sense of hot, sweaty and frenzied jeopardy, but maybe because it has already taken quite a long time to get to this stage, that all comes across as a bit rushed and lacking in punch. It looks great, the visual effects are convincing enough and the production design smoulders perfectly. In the end, though, whilst it proves that MBJ is comfortably able to hold a story, Ryan Coogler has overly relied on a marvellously toe-tapping musical score that has been left to do much of the heavy lifting. That latter point is made more essential by a mediocre audio mix that can make the dialogue quite difficult to make out more often than I’d have liked. This seems to be an increasing issue as directors become more ambitious with their visual aspirations leaving the one thing that cannot be readily faked/augmented - the sound - left at the altar. It’s a cinema film, and will look distinctly average on a television so big screen and soundtrack audio is essential to get the best from this silky looking story with an interesting twist at the end, and again at the very end.",michael b jordan smoke twin brother stack classy drama pair lived wrong side tracks lives determined go home try go straight end buy old barn hope set speakeasy nominal nod prohibition pumping rafters dancing blues music way ally talented musician sammie miles caton course bit baggage siblings return town altogether welcoming home mixture confidence threats collective charisma succeeds assembling crowd opening night pretty swiftly though grand celebration attracts attention travellers keen join party perhaps true charlie daniels style altogether menacing agenda cinematic equivalent lp film starts one side gradually introducing us rich collection characters could quite plausibly lived mississippi time segregation rife illicit booze two recently hailing chicago gives things certain gangster element also subtly powerful effort hailee steinfield mary flip side record proceeds develop elements peril story rather runs steam tries hard create sense hot sweaty frenzied jeopardy maybe already taken quite long time get stage comes across bit rushed lacking punch looks great visual effects convincing enough production design smoulders perfectly end though whilst proves mbj comfortably able hold story ryan coogler overly relied marvellously toe tapping musical score left much heavy lifting latter point made essential mediocre audio mix make dialogue quite difficult make often liked seems increasing issue directors become ambitious visual aspirations leaving one thing readily faked augmented sound left altar cinema film look distinctly average television big screen soundtrack audio essential get best silky looking story interesting twist end end,Negative

Sinners,Action,"Sinners (2025) – A Spiritual, Sonic, Soul-Shaking Masterpiece

There are films that claim to echo with heart, with history, with heritage—and then there is ""Sinners,"" Ryan Coogler’s audacious, transcendent blend of Gothic folklore, musical soulcraft, and cultural reclamation. It doesn’t just echo. It sings. It howls. It bleeds. From its first frame to its devastating final image, Sinners is a full-bodied spiritual experience masquerading as horror—a rare, roaring anomaly that doesn’t fit inside a genre but redefines what cinema can be when it chooses truth over trope.

At the centre of this cinematic exorcism is music—not as adornment, but as DNA. The film’s heartbeat is the blues. And it is through that heartbeat that Coogler tells a tale steeped in generational trauma, Black identity, post-war brotherhood, the spectral weight of history, and the enduring fight for Black ownership in the face of cultural erasure. But unlike anything we've seen before, Sinners fuses those themes with a chilling yet poetic vampire mythos that feels entirely earned, never performative. It is horror, yes—but elevated horror. Arthouse. Operatic. Biblical.

The Blues as Bloodline

Set in the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s, Sinners follows twin brothers Smoke and Stack—both played, exquisitely and with startling distinction, by Michael B. Jordan—who return home to open a juke joint. This place, more than a bar, becomes a church of sorts: a sanctuary of soul, a communal hearthstone where Black folk gather to drink, dance, and reclaim their joy. The walls of the juke joint hum with possibility. With danger. With prophecy. Even if only for one night.

And then there’s the moment. The moment that marks ""Sinners"" not just as a great film, but a holy text of black magic. Sammie, the film’s humble preacher-boy turned guitar savant, takes to the stage. He plays the blues—slow, aching, ancestral. As he sings, the camera glides across the dance floor in a long, liquid motion, capturing the swelling ecstasy of Black joy. And then the music begins to evolve. It morphs, imperceptibly at first, weaving through the history of Black music—African tribal chants, gospel, jazz, funk, soul, R&B, hip-hop—all spiralling into the foundation laid by the blues. It's not a medley; it’s a resurrection. An invocation. This is music as invocation. And in that moment, it summons something darker.

Outside the joint, stands the vampire Remmick, captivated by the sounds, eyes glowing like embers, face lit with a deranged smile. He listens intently, staring into the soul of their cultural history as the place is set spiritually ablaze. Sammie's music called to something ancient. Something seductive. Something that knows the blues because it was born of the same sorrow.

A Clash of Cultures—Scored to Perfection

What Coogler and composer Ludwig Göransson achieve with the film’s score is revolutionary. The music is not just thematic; it is political. It is narrative. When the scenes pulse with Black culture, the music leans blues, jazz, rhythm. But when Remmick and his fellowship—white vampires born of pain and craving—invade, the score rips into metal, into noise. The clash is jarring. Purposeful. It feels like an act of war. The blues is not just an aesthetic—it’s a battlefield. And the music becomes the weapon, the shield, and the lament.

The result is a full-body experience. As Remmick’s power grows, the music becomes louder, more aggressive, less familiar. It’s a stunning metaphor: Black culture, as it always has, being appropriated, corrupted, and consumed until it’s unrecognisable to those who birthed it. And yet, it fights back. Every scene feels like a spiritual wrestling match, waged through melody and rhythm.

Remmick: The Devil At The Door

Jack O’Connell gives a performance so disturbingly charismatic you almost want to follow him into the dark and join his fellowship. Remmick isn’t just a villain—he’s a prophet of perversion.

A being who believes, earnestly, that he is liberating the people he turns. He doesn’t kill for sport; he offers salvation through eternal night. He doesn’t deny his love for Black culture—he craves it. He worships it. He believes the blues is a divine language, one that called him into existence. His monologues are lyrical and damning, his gaze never cruel, always convincing. You don’t root for him. But you understand why someone would.

One scene in particular—outside the joint, where he sings “Picked Poor Robin Clean” in the dark with his newly-turned—should be studied. It is eerily beautiful, the harmony between vampire and victim pitch-perfect, terrifying. When he and his hive recite the Lord’s Prayer in unison with Sammie, the lines between the sacred and the profane dissolve entirely. It’s religious horror at its most potent—unflinching, unforgettable.

Brothers in Arms, Brothers in Grief

Jordan’s dual performance as Smoke and Stack is nothing short of masterful. Stack is lighter, a dreamer. Smoke is war-weathered, clenched, sceptical. But together, they form a complete man—until tragedy forces one to stand alone. There’s a small scene near the end that shattered me more than any of the horror sequences. Smoke, shaking, tries to roll a cigarette for himself, something Stack always did for him. He fails. His hands tremble. A moment so small, yet so laden with grief, PTSD, and love that it lingers long after the credits roll. Coogler knows the power of silence. Of memory. Of unspoken bonds. And I appreciate the care that went into making sure a detail so seemingly small, was given a fitting final detail, that reassured me of the passion that went into every single god damn scene.

The Voice That Summoned the Storm

Miles Caton’s debut as Sammie Moore doesn’t just mark the arrival of a new talent—it announces a generational voice. At just 20, Caton steps into the role of the preacher’s son with a presence that feels both timeless and urgent. His musical roots run deep—raised in a gospel-rich family, he’s been singing since the age of three, and his voice carries that lineage with soulful weight.

Caton not only sings in Sinners but co-wrote the haunting original track “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” with Alice Smith and composer Ludwig Göransson. Learning blues guitar in just two months for the role, his performance in the juke joint sequence is a revelation—channeling pain, power, and prophecy in equal measure. It’s no wonder director Ryan Coogler described him as “a once-in-a-lifetime voice.” Caton’s portrayal of Sammie is the film’s heartbeat—a blend of innocence and depth that lingers long after the credits roll.

Framing the Fire

Autumn Durald Arkapaw’s cinematography in Sinners is nothing short of masterful. Making history as the first female cinematographer to shoot on large-format IMAX film, she crafts a visual narrative that is both expansive and intimate. Utilizing a blend of IMAX and Ultra Panavision 70 formats, the film’s shifting aspect ratios serve the story’s emotional beats—widening to capture the vastness of the Mississippi Delta, then narrowing to draw us into the characters’ inner worlds.

Night scenes glow with a haunting luminescence, firelight dances with purpose, and each frame feels meticulously composed yet organically alive. Arkapaw’s lens doesn’t just show us the world of Sinners—it immerses us in its soul, making the supernatural elements feel grounded and the historical context visceral. Her work elevates the film, turning each scene into a painting that breathes.

Anchors in the Storm

Delroy Lindo's performance is like jazz—unpredictable, soulful, and necessary. He doesn't undercut the film's tension, but rather gives it breath. In a narrative that leans heavy on atmosphere and myth, he injects a kind of familial levity that feels earned and lived-in. His presence is grounding, a reminder of what’s at stake when the horror threatens to strip the story of its humanity. And then there’s Hailee Steinfeld, as Mary, bringing a layered grace to the screen—mischievous, magnetic, and caught between identities. Raised with Smoke and Stack, her loyalty runs deep, but her character exists in a space that blurs lines—between belonging and otherness, tradition and disruption. There's a quiet poetry to how her arc unfolds, and you’re left wondering whether she’s a reflection of what it means to straddle cultures, or a symbol of something even more elusive. Either way, she leaves a mark—fierce and unforgettable. And then there's Wunmi Mosaku’s portrayal of Annie, which anchors the film with a quiet yet potent strength. She is a bridge to ancestral wisdom, embodying the resilience and spiritual power of the Black community. Her presence is not loud, but her influence is undeniable—rooted in healing and protection, offering a steady counterpoint to the chaos around her. Annie doesn’t just fight evil with wisdom—she fights to preserve the very soul of her people.

This soul isn't for sale

And in a film layered with metaphor and meaning, black ownership doesn’t just echo—it resounds. It's not a theme that visits—it’s the architecture. And Sammie becomes the embodiment of that principle. His music, his soul, his presence—they’re not just narrative devices, they’re battlegrounds. There’s a moment—powerful, worded like an offer but weighted like a threat—where what’s being asked isn’t blood or vengeance, but ownership of that brilliance. Remmick offers everybody else their lives if they let him take Sammie, but Slim responds ""he's ours."" It’s not a loud moment. But it cuts deep. And it’s in the refusal—in the stillness of collective resistance—that the film finds one of its most potent truths. That cultural power isn’t just about legacy—it’s about protection, unity, and the refusal to be harvested.

Beyond the Oscars

There are films designed to win Oscars. And then there are films like Sinners—films that make awards feel meaningless. Because what do statues mean when you’ve built a monument? Sinners is that monument. To music. To Blackness. To art. To survival. To Cinema. It doesn’t just earn your praise. It earns your soul.

In a world where genre cinema often feels disposable, Sinners is an inheritance. A film made by people who love the culture deeply enough to protect it, critique it, and immortalise it. It is horror not just of the supernatural, but of history, of identity, of being seen and erased all at once.

Sinners,Action,"ALERT: might be spoilers lurking here.

Thankfully I didn't see any film trailers but I did glance over a few magazine covers to see it was a movie about twins and vampires.

What I didn't know was that it was also a period piece so that was a surprise.

How the vampires appeared was also a surprise. I  thought one of the twins was already a vampire and had somehow hidden it from his brother.

I liked the Stephen King aspect of ordinary day turning to sh!t and good luck surviving.

What was missed in all the reviews I saw here: spiritual and cultural aspects that may have gone over folks' heads.

Did anyone understand Mary's real link to the Black community? What does her survival as a vampire say about that precarious aspect of her previous life versus her life after life?

Did anyone see an almost mockery of religion in the vampires' siren call and the ""triumph"" of the Black church in Sammie's survival?

How does this flow with narratives of good versus evil?

Freedom is an overarching theme. 

Free to go north and work for gangsters. Free to own property/open a juke joint. Free to enjoy an evening of dance and drink. Free to LIVE.

Money is supposed to bring freedom but money that spends only in the Delta won't free anyone. 

Music offers the unification that could quell separatism but isn't always able to deliver the promise.

Musicians forced to play for racists by the police. Vampires singing to lure Sammie out. The singing at church. The singing in the juke joint. Sammie surviving to sing and play for several more decades.

Any freedom in the world of Sinners is temporary at best.

This movie is multi-layered. 

You have to see it multiple times to see it.

you a different perspective each time.",alert might spoilers lurking thankfully see film trailers glance magazine covers see movie twins vampires know also period piece surprise vampires appeared also surprise thought one twins already vampire somehow hidden brother liked stephen king aspect ordinary day turning sh good luck surviving missed reviews saw spiritual cultural aspects may gone folks heads anyone understand mary real link black community survival vampire say precarious aspect previous life versus life life anyone see almost mockery religion vampires siren call triumph black church sammie survival flow narratives good versus evil freedom overarching theme free go north work gangsters free property open juke joint free enjoy evening dance drink free live money supposed bring freedom money spends delta free anyone music offers unification could quell separatism always able deliver promise musicians forced play racists police vampires singing lure sammie singing church singing juke joint sammie surviving sing play several decades freedom world sinners temporary best movie multi layered see multiple times see guessing time see hear something missed time giving different perspective time,Negative

The Twisters,Action,"The 2024 The Twisters is an exciting but flawed disaster film that offers moments of thrilling action alongside noticeable weaknesses.

The movie does a good job of capturing the chaos and danger of tornadoes, and it’s engaging enough to keep you watching. However, the characters feel underdeveloped, making it hard to connect with their struggles. The visual effects, crucial in a film about natural disasters, often fall short of being convincing, which weakens the impact of the tornado sequences.

A Working Man,Action,"<em>'A Working Man'</em> is imperfectly very good. I do have a couple of issues with it, but all in all I have to say that I did enjoy this to a fairly strong degree. Jason Statham seldom disappoints in an action thriller, I'm a fan of his so was always likely to get the required fun out of this.

Statham is great, naturally without him the movie would be vastly less entertaining. Away from the former British diver (still can't quite believe that's the same guy!), there are too many characters - which is one of the issues I have. There didn't need to be so many peeps in this.

Even so, those onscreen are all decent enough and none register as overt negatives in my mind. David Harbour does well in a small role, he usually speaks the same way in roles but this feels minorly different. Michael Peña and Arianna Rivas are solid, as is Jason Flemyng.

The latter's character should've be the only bad guy in this, or at least one of a few. He gives enough that we didn't need anyone else in my opinion, especially as 'higher-ups' Andrej Kaminsky and Maximilian Osinski give weaker performances. Chidi Ajufo is the best of the rest.

My other issue lies with the run time. I guess with so many characters it did need to be almost two hours in length, however you could've told this story within 90 minutes without a doubt. But again, as noticeable as that and the other issue is, it at least doesn't hinder much for me.",em working man em imperfectly good couple issues say enjoy fairly strong degree jason statham seldom disappoints action thriller fan always likely get required fun statham great naturally without movie would vastly less entertaining away former british diver still quite believe guy many characters one issues need many peeps even onscreen decent enough none register overt negatives mind david harbour well small role usually speaks way roles feels minorly different michael pe arianna rivas solid jason flemyng latter character bad guy least one gives enough need anyone else opinion especially higher ups andrej kaminsky maximilian osinski give weaker performances chidi ajufo best rest issue lies run time guess many characters need almost two hours length however could told story within minutes without doubt noticeable issue least hinder much,Negative
A Working Man,Action,"""A working Man"" is an accidental satire, of the US action film genre.

Working class guy, who served in the military and now works for a migrant families construction company, looks to save their angelic daughter, the vision of perfection, from the evil Russian human traffickers. 

Everything is an exaggeration. From the notion of the working class guy, a rough diamond, a patriot,  with a heart of gold. The migrant family with the dutiful, over achiever on steroids daughter, the true inheritors of the American dream. Even, the minimum wage construction workers, who are told to make sure they ""keep their fingers"" (you can see occupational health and safety is a big thing) are so happy they look like they belong in the original production of ""Snow White"" (the real one, not the hideous remake). As for the Russians, well surprise, surprise, they are brutal, cruel and stupid. No one saw that coming, right?

I won't mix words, this is cliched, biased, condescending, pro Western military, jingoistic, crap. Interesting too, how venture capitalists ""State Street"" make a brief appearance, in the opening credits. If they thought this would lift their profile, well all I can say is it didn't ""do it, for me"". Sorry guys. 

Is there an upside? In short no. Even the action has a ham fisted, ""seen it all before"", air of stale, stagnation, about it. 

In summary, a horrible facsimile of superior action films, you have probably seen before. Loaded down with trite cliches, stereotypes and jarring biases. One to avoid.",working man accidental satire us action film genre working class guy served military works migrant families construction company looks save angelic daughter vision perfection evil russian human traffickers everything exaggeration notion working class guy rough diamond patriot heart gold migrant family dutiful achiever steroids daughter true inheritors american dream even minimum wage construction workers told make sure keep fingers see occupational health safety big thing happy look like belong original production snow white real one hideous remake russians well surprise surprise brutal cruel stupid one saw coming right mix words cliched biased condescending pro western military jingoistic crap interesting venture capitalists state street make brief appearance opening credits thought would lift profile well say sorry guys upside short even action ham fisted seen air stale stagnation summary horrible facsimile superior action films probably seen loaded trite cliches stereotypes jarring biases one avoid,Positive
A Working Man,Action,"On paper, director David Ayer‘s revenge action thriller “A Working Man” should be a slam dunk for Jason Statham. Based on Chuck Dixon’s novel “Levon’s Trade,” it has all the familiar elements that not only cater to the actor’s strengths, but also to the desires of his most die hard fans. Unfortunately, very little about the film works, and it comes across as dull, predictable, and unmemorable.

Levon (Statham) is a former black ops solider turned construction worker who is forced to return to his lethal past when his boss’s daughter (Arianna Rivas) is abducted by human traffickers. What starts as a rescue mission soon unravels a deeper web of corruption, pushing Levon to do what he does best: take down bad guys with ruthless efficiency.

The premise is well-worn but serviceable, but never quite rises above its own mediocrity. The stunt work is strong and the fights are bloody, but the action sequences mostly lack the punch and creativity needed to garner any feelings of excitement. The action is middling, which makes the uninspired story stand out in the worst way.

Even worse, the film lacks personality. It’s competently made but painfully generic, with a by-the-numbers plot that fails to generate any real emotional stakes. The script (co-written by Ayer and Sylvester Stallone) doesn’t do enough to elevate the material beyond standard action fare.

Despite being well cast, the film wastes a terrific supporting turn from David Harbour, and it feels like the reliable tough guy Statham is running on autopilot. Nobody enjoys watching a movie where the lead actor is delivering a performance that feels more like a contractual obligation than a passion project.

Working in harmony with Ayer’s directorial style, Shawn White’s cinematography proves to be the brightest spot. This is a polished, good looking action thriller, at least visually speaking.

If I had to sum up “A Working Man” in one word, it would be “serviceable.” This is a film that will be buried under Statham’s long list of similar (and much better) movies.

A Working Man,Action,"Well if you just thought Jason Statham was going to make a movie about the dangers of the construction industry then the first few scenes will put you straight and give a clue that his past is altogether more violent. That is going to come in handy when the daughter of his boss is kidnapped-to-order by some people traffickers and he is, initially reluctantly, drafted into track her down. With consummate ease, he sets about his task facing down some of the menacing Russian brotherhood who rule the roost supplying girls, drugs and booze to whoever can afford to pay! Can he find the girl? Will the sun come up? There’s not the slightest hint of jeopardy to any of this derivative outing for a star whose usual charisma has been left in his Winnebago. It’s got bits of “Die Hard” (1988) mixed in with, I thought, that Clint Eastwood “Cry Macho” (2021) affair plus the seriously camped up pairing of Jason Flemyng and Maximilian Osinski to make sure that any scintilla of credibility was well and truly throttled after about fifteen minutes of this repetitive and predictable drama. Sylvester Stallone had an hand in the writing - I suppose someone had to put the full stops in the script, and David Ayer shows little, is any, flair as the thing lumbers along for what seems like a lot longer than two hours.

Captain America: Brave New World,Action,"<em>'Captain America: Brave New World'</em> came close to pleasing me, but in the end I think it is not consistently enjoyable enough to be classed as something I'd want to watch again and/or recommend. There is quite a bit about it that I did like, but the down moments hurt the ups.

The cast and their characters are positives. I'm a big fan of Anthony Mackie's as he has done many roles in films that I've highly, highly enjoyed; interestingly, he has appeared in three of the fourteen films I've given a total 10/10 to. Here, he is very good in the titular part.

I'm not someone overly attached to Marvel and therefore Chris Evans' Captain America, so this new era doesn't hinder my interest in the lead character. I'm admittedly not wholly convinced Mackie is undoubtedly a perfect fit for the role, though his performance itself is perfectly watchable and fun enough.

Carl Lumbly's performance as Isaiah is great in this, he genuinely made me care quite a bit about Bradley; especially in the more emotive scenes. Danny Ramirez, Harrison Ford, Giancarlo Esposito (a little typecast still, sadly) and Tim Blake Nelson (albeit the weakest) are also pluses that I have for this movie.

My main issues lie with the plot and how it is told. There were too many moments where I could feel myself losing interest in events onscreen, most notably across the first half. The second half is better paced, if still not making for superb viewing. I was firmly awaiting the credits, which is never a good sign.

When I was locked on to the story, I did dig it. I particularly found the interactions/dynamics between characters to be solid, for example Cap with Carl, Joaquin and Seth. I just think what lets this down, unfortunately to a somewhat damaging degree, is that the plot just isn't quite good enough. A shorter run time (even though it isn't that long) may have helped, but I'm not sure.

I just realised that this is the first MCU film that I've scored below 7/10. That feels harsh, it isn't as bad as that sounds at all, but thinking about this and the other flicks from the franchise that I've rated similarly it is actually merited. <em>'The Incredible Hulk'</em> and <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</em> were my bottom two, both are better films.",em captain america brave new world em came close pleasing end think consistently enjoyable enough classed something want watch recommend quite bit like moments hurt ups cast characters positives big fan anthony mackie done many roles films highly highly enjoyed interestingly appeared three fourteen films given total good titular part someone overly attached marvel therefore chris evans captain america new era hinder interest lead character admittedly wholly convinced mackie undoubtedly perfect fit role though performance perfectly watchable fun enough carl lumbly performance isaiah great genuinely made care quite bit bradley especially emotive scenes danny ramirez harrison ford giancarlo esposito little typecast still sadly tim blake nelson albeit weakest also pluses movie main issues lie plot told many moments could feel losing interest events onscreen notably across first half second half better paced still making superb viewing firmly awaiting credits never good sign locked story dig particularly found interactions dynamics characters solid example cap carl joaquin seth think lets unfortunately somewhat damaging degree plot quite good enough shorter run time even though long may helped sure realised first mcu film scored feels harsh bad sounds thinking flicks franchise rated similarly actually merited em incredible hulk em em ant man wasp em bottom two better films,Negative
Captain America: Brave New World,Action,"“Brave New World” but same old yarn, sadly. Morgan Freeman clearly didn’t fancy this one so Marvel have resurrected another ex-president in Harrison Ford to put together a treaty that will deliver the old save the globe type of thing. It’s all about this giant hand-shaped structure that has emerged from the ocean and that contains “adamantium” - and that’s even more indestructible than “Vibranium” (how can something be more indestructible?). Anyway, before this accord can get signed off by a curious quadrumvirate of the USA, India, France and China a shipment of this new material gets pinched and it’s down to “Capt. America” (Anthony Mackie) and his new sidekick “Torres/Falcon” (Danny Ramirez) to retrieve it. Loads of end-to-end fisticuffs later and the goods are secure which earns our dynamic duo and their inspirational trainer “Bradley” (Carl Lumbly) an invitation to the White House. That’s where the wheels really do come off as their pal starts taking potshots at the President and we discover that the erstwhile somewhat militaristic and temperamental “Ross” and “Cap” aren’t exactly on the same page. It’s pretty obvious that there’s a third party pulling the strings so it’s going to need all of his patience and guile if the shielded wonder is to retrieve his mentor from solitary, rebuild his relationship with his president before that man really sees red, and also get to the bottom of a dastardly scheme that seems bent on causing international strife between the USA and Japan. Mackie’s a charismatic man and he does what he can with this, but the story comes across as little more than an hybrid of “Top Gun” (1986) meets “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997) with an unremarkable cast, including Ford’s “Ross”, that struggles to make any impact as it races along for two hours without presenting anything original or particularly entertaining. It passes the time, but is yet another bland offering from a studio that is increasingly resorting to it’s creative technicians to design something that looks great but resonates not remotely.

Captain America: Brave New World,Action,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ movieswetextedabout.com/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-deserves-to-wield-the-shield/

""Captain America: Brave New World may not reach the high bar set by its direct predecessors, but it's far from the disaster some claim it to be.

Despite its evident production flaws, Julius Onah still manages to deliver moments of real entertainment, supported by a charismatic cast and well-crafted action sequences. Most importantly, Anthony Mackie's performance as Sam Wilson proves, without a doubt, that he was the right choice to wield the shield left behind by Steve Rogers.

Captain America: Brave New World,Action,"While I find it the same general quality of a majority of what Marvel has put out, it is a flawed film with moments you could tell were caused from one of the many reshoots they did of the film. (It was shot 4 times) One funny example is when Cap and Falcon are on the run they ""ditch their smart phones"" so they can't be tracked. Leaving them in their offices. On the Car ride to their destination, Falcon isn't wearing a watch. Then at the destination he's wearing a Smart Watch. You know something that can be tracked..... Anyway it was off putting to have Hulk's cast and Villains but not included him, at all. Not even a photo, just ""old news footage"" from the Harlem battle. Mr Blue doesn't even mention Bruce at all. Instead blaming everything on Ross.

What the film did have, I'm sure it makes much more since if you watched Falcon&Winter Solider, but if you didn't they sort of explain things in the film. At least the short 1 dialogue explain it way. The ending battle was a, what the heck? Move and what happened to the President make little Legal since, although in one cut of the film he died. Because Bruce nor She Hulk are in prison, so at best they would keep him locked up until he learned to control it. As the illegal thing he did was, what the Accords already did, keeping a dangerous super locked up. Not very well, but still the same thing. Definitely not as bad as some say it is, but not joining the few MCU films I will rewatch or rewatch over and over again.

Captain America: Brave New World,Action,"Captain America: Brave New World doesn't do anything brave or new. 

Its ""safe"", by the numbers, US rules the world, superhero narrative, is wholly familiar. I will add, I was disappointed by the effort to portray Israel in a positive light, given their appalling behaviour on the world stage.

Captain America: Brave New World,Action,"Captain America: Brave New World was overall an enjoyable watch, even if it had a few noticeable flaws. Anthony Mackie truly shines in this film as Sam Wilson, more so than in his previous appearances. He brings charisma, sincerity, and depth to the role of Captain America in a way that finally feels fully realized. The supporting cast was equally strong, though Harrison Ford’s portrayal of President Thaddeus Ross, while solid, came across as a bit stiff and frankly, as if he was a little too old for the role. He did bring gravitas, but it sometimes felt like he lacked the physical presence the character demanded.

However, the film stumbled in a few areas that impacted my overall enjoyment. My main gripe was with the final battle sequence. Sam Wilson, a fully human character without the super-soldier serum, directly confronting and battling a Hulk-level threat stretched believability too far. It felt unrealistic even by Marvel standards, detracting from the otherwise solid storytelling.

The subplot involving Sam debating whether or not to take the super-soldier serum was also underwhelming and repetitive. We've seen similar storylines explored before in the MCU, and this didn't add much new depth or meaningful insight into Sam’s character. It seemed to slow down the momentum rather than enhance the narrative.

Another puzzling choice was the extensive callbacks to 2008’s The Incredible Hulk. Given the significant differences in tone, actors, and general feel, the tie-ins felt forced and disconnected. The reliance on such an old and somewhat obscure MCU entry was distracting and didn’t resonate emotionally.

Despite these flaws, there was plenty to like. The film's pacing was mostly good, the action sequences well-choreographed, and visually, it delivered exactly what you'd expect from Marvel. Red Hulk was very cool when he finally appeared, and his presence boosted the film's overall entertainment value.

In short, Captain America: Brave New World is worth watching for Marvel fans, particularly for its strong characters and compelling action. However, Marvel needs to either commit to realistic storytelling for human-level heroes or provide them with suitable enhancements or foes.

Jurassic World Dominion,Action,"""Owen"" (Chris Pratt) and ""Claire"" (Bryce Dallas Howard) are living in the remote wilderness with ""Maisie"" (Isabella Sermon), whom they are desperate to protect. From what? Well it turns out she is a bit of a miraculous conception from the ""Lockwood"" dynasty that co-founded the original park with ""Hammond"" and is very much on the radar of corporate megalomanic ""Dodgson"" (Campbell Scott) whose company is devising super-engineered locusts to devour great swathes of crops across the United States that are not grown from their own brand of seed. This is where ""Sattler"" (Laura Dern) comes in. She is convinced of this dastardly plan, but must compare the DNA of one from his lab with one they secured in the wild so she can prove it. Her plan enlists the help of old pal ""Grant"" (Sam Neill) and with the help of their intellectual nemesis ""Malcolm"" (a suitably contrarian effort from Jeff Goldblum) they secure an invitation to the company's sanctuary in the Italian Dolomites. Meantime, the young girl is abducted from her wintry home, as is the baby of velociraptor ""Blue"" and so Pratt and Howard have to track them down, and that takes them on some quickly paced, but hardly original, set piece adventures where they meet pilot ""Kayla"" (DeWanda Wise). She chips in to help them in what now reminded me of aspects of the Brendan Fraser ""Mummy"" films, before they also end up in the Italian mountains. Can they team up and thwart the cunning plan? The problem with this, is that there are just way too many characters and too many weakly constructed threads to the story going on. It's all too diffuse and serendipity in the last hour or so just takes far too great a hand in the way the narrative combines and develops. The dinosaur effects are still amazing, but oddly enough I felt them less effective than in previous iterations - there just aren't enough scenes that feature them and when they do, they are just under-used. Pratt is always good value for me, but here he looks out of sorts and hardly features at all; Scott just doesn't cut it as the malevolent baddie (though could his character be the same guy who tried to buy the specimens in the first film?) and Sam Neill relies too much on his bemused facial expressions - indeed his best work on this is pretty much all included in the trailers.

Jurassic World Dominion,Action,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/jurassic-world-dominion-spoiler-free-review

""Jurassic World Dominion is a massive disappointment on virtually every level. With an incredibly captivating premise, Colin Trevorrow ignores the fascinating years of mankind trying to deal with the chaos of dinosaurs repopulating Earth, opting instead to write a generic, formulaic, surprisingly tedious screenplay.

In addition to the lousy character treatment, the cast is divided into two storylines focused on nonsensical, bland rescue and espionage missions, placing dinosaurs on the back burner during the excessively long runtime.

Action sequences reach drastically low entertainment levels, sometimes imperceptible due to erratic camera work and choppy editing.

The cast, visuals, and score might save this from being a complete trainwreck, but not from miserably failing to deliver an epic conclusion to a saga that deserved nothing less than that.""

Jurassic World Dominion,Action,"With _Jurassic World Dominion_, a _Jurassic World_ film where dinosaurs are now free and interacting with the modern world shouldn’t feel this long-winded or this tiresome. There are a few action sequences that are worthwhile and Jeff Goldblum has a few great one-liners (“You made a promise to a dinosaur?”), but the film is a monumental disappointment overall.

The film has already made over $415 million at the worldwide box office, so the interest in the franchise is still there. But the chemistry between the cast is almost non-existent and it feels like the film is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel. If the _Jurassic Park/Jurassic World_ franchise is to continue, it desperately needs to go in a refreshing and unseen direction. Now that all of the nostalgia is out of the way, fans deserve a refreshing and unique adventure over what is otherwise a glorified rehash.

Jurassic World Dominion,Action,"<em>'Jurassic World Dominion'</em> is far from perfect, if just about entertaining to watch... kinda.

I'm not fully convinced by it but I do think there's enough in there that's worth watching. There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing.

Still, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard.

The run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though.

Jurassic World Dominion,Action,"So after watching the first four movies in this franchise (three of which I had seen more than once, I finally watched this most recent effort. There are similarities and differences between Dominion and the earlier ones.

It held some of the usual elements: a child for us to care when they placed her in danger; the ability of the heroes (even the child) to outrun dinosaurs under a blind panic; walking dinosaur food, also known as bad guys; and references to the original theme park that started it all. They outdid themselves this time - keep an eye out for the Barbasol shaving cream canister.

Of course, there are plenty of differences also. Parts of it weren’t even recognizable as part of the franchise. They juggle plot lines around the dinosaurs, the ethics of genetic engineering, a child clone kidnapping, industrial malfeasance, and what for me was the most interesting subplot and most closely tied to the original film: the struggle for humans and dinosaurs to co-exist under the new planetary paradigm. 

Another difference is that there are two romances developing throughout the film.

An improvement is the return of characters we know well: Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant are back, and Ian Malcolm is present long enough to get in a few of his witticisms, unlike in the last movie.

So ultimately I found Dominion to be entertaining enough to stick with it, though the aspects that might have been intended to make me think just sort of got in the way.",watching first four movies franchise three seen finally watched recent effort similarities differences dominion earlier ones held usual elements child us care placed danger ability heroes even child outrun dinosaurs blind panic walking dinosaur food also known bad guys references original theme park started outdid time keep eye barbasol shaving cream canister course plenty differences also parts even recognizable part franchise juggle plot lines around dinosaurs ethics genetic engineering child clone kidnapping industrial malfeasance interesting subplot closely tied original film struggle humans dinosaurs co exist new planetary paradigm another difference two romances developing throughout film improvement return characters know well ellie sattler alan grant back ian malcolm present long enough get witticisms unlike last movie ultimately found dominion entertaining enough stick though aspects might intended make think sort got way,Positive

Jurassic World Dominion,Action,"Well, the dinosaur special effects are quite decent. Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this movie.

I really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent story/script writer? I mean come on, the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen “big companies are bad” story with dinosaurs thrown in.

The story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack. Things more or less just happen and the “heroes” fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring. And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the “heroes” doesn’t just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?

Idiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.

They brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help. The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there. Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte. I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one. The bad guy totally lacks charisma. The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle Watts.

It is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by today’s Hollywood morons.

Jurassic World Dominion,Action,"**_The Jurassic Park protagonists come together in Marvel’s Savage Land, minus Ka-Zar_**

As dinosaurs freely roam the Earth, Owen & Claire (Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard) seek to find their kidnapped adopted daughter (Isabella Sermon), which takes them to Malta and then a remote dinosaur preserve in the Dolomite Mountains of northeastern Italy. Meanwhile Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant (Laura Dern and Sam Neill) have serious concerns about the remote facility wherein they reunite with Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).
   
""Jurassic World: Dominion"" (2022) isn’t great like the previous “Fallen Kingdom” (2018) and is arguably the least of the second trilogy. There are some Indiana Jones elements in the Malta segment and James Bond bits at the technologically advanced lair in the mountains, both of which I appreciate.

Yet I strangely never bought the characters as real people. They always struck me as actors performing according to a contrived script, which tries too hard to check the diversity boxes. Still, there’s certainly enough here to entertain if you’re interested in a dinosaur-oriented sci-fi adventure.  

The film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes, with the Extended Version running just over 12 minutes longer (I viewed the latter). The primary shooting locations include British Columbia, Malta, Hawaii and the UK (Pinewood Studios).

Jurassic World Dominion,Action,"Jurassic World Dominion fails to impress as a dinosaur movie, as the plot seems to be a poor choice. The dinosaurs are present but not the main focus, giving the impression that they are only there to extend the franchise. Even the inclusion of Alan Grant seems to be more for nostalgic purposes than contributing to the story. Chris Pratt's character also appears to be underutilized and serves more as a prop rather than a leading character.

The camera work in the movie is particularly shoddy, with cuts from one angle to another creating confusion, especially in fast-paced scenes like the one in Malta. The depiction of Malta in the movie is also disappointing, with the country portrayed as a dirty, third-world Arabic nation covered in desert sand, which is not an accurate representation of the country. The use of Arabic style music in the background also seems out of place and unnecessary.

Overall, Jurassic World Dominion seems to be a movie that was made to extend the franchise rather than being a well-planned and executed story. It is disappointing that a franchise that should have stopped by the third installment continues to churn out mediocre movies. Although the movie is not a complete disaster, it falls short of being an enjoyable watch. 

Additionally, the length of the movie seems to be excessive, and the dragging plot does not help in holding the audience's attention. The story's predictability adds to the monotony, leaving little to surprise or engage the viewers.

As if to acknowledge the franchise's overreliance on gimmicks and sequels, Ian Malcolm's line, ""Jurassic World? Not a fan,"" serves as a meta-commentary on the movie itself. It is a nod to the fans who have been disappointed by the franchise's recent offerings, and unfortunately, Jurassic World Dominion does little to change that sentiment. 5/10",jurassic world dominion fails impress dinosaur movie plot seems poor choice dinosaurs present main focus giving impression extend franchise even inclusion alan grant seems nostalgic purposes contributing story chris pratt character also appears underutilized serves prop rather leading character camera work movie particularly shoddy cuts one angle another creating confusion especially fast paced scenes like one malta depiction malta movie also disappointing country portrayed dirty third world arabic nation covered desert sand accurate representation country use arabic style music background also seems place unnecessary overall jurassic world dominion seems movie made extend franchise rather well planned executed story disappointing franchise stopped third installment continues churn mediocre movies although movie complete disaster falls short enjoyable watch additionally length movie seems excessive dragging plot help holding audience attention story predictability adds monotony leaving little surprise engage viewers acknowledge franchise overreliance gimmicks sequels ian malcolm line jurassic world fan serves meta commentary movie nod fans disappointed franchise recent offerings unfortunately jurassic world dominion little change sentiment,Positive

Our eponymous blue hedgehog, his best pals ""Tails"" and ""Knuckles"" have settled down to a peaceable life with ""Tom"" (James Marsden) and ""Maddie"" (Tika Sumpter) but realise they have to rise to the occasion so off they go. Imagine their shock, though, when they discover that their new super-fast and super-strong nemesis is another (not quite so blue) hedgehog! Who is he? What's going on? Why does he seem to loath mankind, so? Well that all becomes clear when his puppet-master turns out to be the grand-daddy of all baddies. The ultimate ""Robotnik"" - only with a slightly more rotund belly. Matched, even out-matched, it falls to our intrepid team to try and form an alliance of their own, but how will that endure in the face of such terrible odds? Well don't go looking for any jeopardy here, indeed what starts off as quite a fun series of thwack and pow escapades showing off the skills of the rivals cannot resist turning into the cul-de-sac of sentimentality as the inevitable plot lines grab hold of the characters and turn them into cheesy mush. I always like a good antagonist, but sadly we just know that however dastardly and evil he - in this case the ultra-hammy Jim Carrey - can be, no writer or director is ever going to let him win, and that's pretty efficiently telegraphed right from the start of this sequel that's going to be a prequel too, no doubt. Some of the writing is quite fun, with plenty of contemporary and quite sarcastic references to raise a smile, and there are homages paid aplenty to just about everyone from ""007"" and the ""Fantastic Four"" to the ""Avengers"" - but in the end it's all just a little too shiny and predicable.

Warfare,Action,"A squad of American soldiers seemingly randomly select an house in Ramadi and having relocated it’s sleeping occupants to the ground floor, set up a sniper station from where they can monitor the goings on around them. Initially, this all looks harmless enough as the Iraqi locals go about their business, but gradually the spotters become suspicious of repetitive activity, the odd person who seems to be snooping on them - and then, well all hell breaks loose leaving them facing an existential threat that will test their mettle, their equipment and require some feats of legerdemain if they are to survive long enough to be rescued. There is quite some intensity to this drama as the young men under siege must each deal with their fears, strengths and weaknesses under a constant stream of fire. Will Poulter’s “Erik” leads the team, but the best effort for me came from his comms man “Ray” (D’Pharoah Woon-A-Tai) and, though sparingly, from Kit Connor’s rookie “Tommy” who, like us watching, had no idea what they were doing in this house and what the purpose of their mission actually was in the first place. There isn’t so much a script as an increasingly nervous dialogue that disintegrates as their predicament becomes more perilous and the photography and particularly the audio serve really well in conveying a sense of the lethally claustrophobic atmosphere in which these men had to function. Real veterans wrote the story, advised the production and that shows in something that is certainly incomplete from a narrative perspective, but is uncomfortably enthralling to watch and graphically displays the horrors of urban warfare.",squad american soldiers seemingly randomly select house ramadi relocated sleeping occupants ground floor set sniper station monitor goings around initially looks harmless enough iraqi locals go business gradually spotters become suspicious repetitive activity odd person seems snooping well hell breaks loose leaving facing existential threat test mettle equipment require feats legerdemain survive long enough rescued quite intensity drama young men siege must deal fears strengths weaknesses constant stream fire poulter erik leads team best effort came comms man ray pharoah woon tai though sparingly kit connor rookie tommy like us watching idea house purpose mission actually first place much script increasingly nervous dialogue disintegrates predicament becomes perilous photography particularly audio serve really well conveying sense lethally claustrophobic atmosphere men function real veterans wrote story advised production shows something certainly incomplete narrative perspective uncomfortably enthralling watch graphically displays horrors urban warfare,Negative

The plot being told in real time makes it rather captivating too, the tone of either trepidation or torment is omnipresent.

Well, I say omnipresent, that's taking out the opening scene. I was not expecting that! Very fun though and a good way to show a snapshot of the camaraderie. It shouldn't work because it's not like it matches the rest of the film, but I gotta say I really loved it. What a tune, by the way.

It's a fairly stacked cast list, from Will Poulter to Joseph Quinn to Charles Melton to Michael Gandolfini to D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai.

Warfare,Action,"""Warfare"" is as simple a statement as you can get, on the reality of conflict.

Warfare can be dull, even bureaucratic, with its own language, spoken over radio in codes. Equally, its frenetic, violent and horribly visceral. 

We see all of these aspects of war, in this film. I'll admit its depressing, sad, underlining in blood, the wastefulness of war. Mind you, that's what war is. Not heroic, symphonic, grandiose. 

Suffice to say, I liked this film. Its unpretentious and makes you question, not only the need for war but attempts to make it appear noble, when clearly, its nothing of the kind.

""Warfare is a film you admire more than you enjoy. Its anti-narrative structure, slow pacing, and lack of strong central figures make it difficult to revisit - but impossible to forget.

It's a remarkable display of technical realism, a brutally honest recreation of a war zone, and a testament to cinema's power when it refuses to play by the rules. Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza may not have crafted a universally captivating masterpiece, but they've created something undeniably authentic.

Deadpool & Wolverine,Action,"Its story may not be the strongest, but the comedy makes <em>'Deadpool & Wolverine'</em> an excellent watch!

There are some top notch gags in there, particularly to do with the recent offscreen changes for Wade Wilson's alter ego. As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.

Reynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.

As noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original?

Deadpool & Wolverine,Action,"In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom’s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering’s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy’s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don’t. I suppose that’s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren’t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture’s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise’s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn’t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I’d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",moviemaking sadly problem going well many times latest installment one filmdom better cinematic franchises verges proving offering predecessors significantly distinguished kind fare typically found superhero genre outrageously bawdy humor hilarious sight gags relentlessly maverick attitude time however director shawn levy latest effort decidedly hit miss affair often incoherent script feels like cobbled together collection leftover parts work suppose entirely surprising screenplay penned four different writers making wonder much consensus place compiling finished product moreover film appears intended fold deadpool franchise x men franchise intriguing idea regrettably handled rather clumsily often case many recent fusion offerings marvel universe bad enough release gives short shrift colorful cast supporting players made deadpool films funny original enjoyable relegating little cameos favor walk ons host mcu characters remarkably obscure might add attempt help cement franchise cross pollination going makes awkward storytelling times especially viewers might familiar lesser known figures drawn marvel source material unrelated big screen offerings picture credit features yet another stellar turn ryan reynolds color protagonist well share hilarious bits without doubt franchise historically strongest suit including number unabashed razor sharp asides referencing screen developments related studios produced films actors appeared strengths notwithstanding however production sadly watered elements best made franchise work favor overarching programming agenda simply serve film series particularly well creators would served viewers better sticking works basics good storytelling trying force issue sake future productions may may work long term noticeable downfall quality many recent marvel universe releases truly hate see franchise befall similar fate,Negative

Deadpool & Wolverine,Action,"Well the ""Deadpool"" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old ""Dead"". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed ""Wolverine/Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing ""Paradox"" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down ""Cassandra Nova"" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of ""Xavier"" who presides over the void. That's a ""Mad Max"" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by ""Paradox"" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",well deadpool concept well truly immersed marvel multi verse really fear good old dead well actually ryan reynolds reverted occasionally quite vulgar humour first film allowed trequel focus personality irreverent immortal superhero tries resurrect recently departed wolverine logan hugh jackman save timeline erasure thwart comically menacing paradox matthew macfadyen face cassandra nova emma corrin happens long estranged twin sister xavier presides void mad max style desert style territory undesirables put paradox organisation years initially love lost two heroes cocky man red lycra impress new booze soaked guilt ridden buddy quickly manage align priorities well yes guess rest indeed nothing remotely unpredictable shout loudly proudly knows trying reinvent wheel succeeding pointing multi verse films simply adjust space time continuum provide new setting old stories ad characters stop audience bore repetitive combat cycles nondescript plot lines maybe reynolds egg smuttiness little still plenty wry comments industry product placement plethora films actors preceded delivering old old forgotten entertain us loads action scenes amiable chemistry two actors clearly suitably sarcastic page throughout two hours also features fun cameos likes messrs evans snipes cavill favreau tatum keep moving along effervescence spirit big screen essential lot effort gone production work well telly enjoyed,Negative
Deadpool & Wolverine,Action,"Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.

Reynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film’s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman’s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it’s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.

The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film’s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.

The film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.

Despite its comedic approach, the film doesn’t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.

This isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool’s irreverent humor doesn’t clash with the MCU’s established tone.

Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It’s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",deadpool wolverine movie truly believe marvel cinematic universe mcu needed years lackluster installments film breath fresh air ryan reynolds hugh jackman director shawn levy approached project care deep understanding fans want film feels like crafted fans fans particularly frustrated recent phases mcu reynolds levy brought team writers strong background comedy storytelling decision pays film humor narrative sharp engaging example meta vibe deadpool familiar previous two films ramped significantly movie spares one making jokes everything hugh jackman recent divorce ryan reynolds career however mcu receives pointed critical jokes resonate long time fans chemistry reynolds jackman electric bringing new life characters dynamic hilarious heartfelt making compelling narrative instance scenes deadpool wolverine banter taking enemies filled wit energy showcasing unique bond camaraderie extends film supporting cast well timed cameos clever nods previous marvel movies film self awareness willingness poke fun franchise refreshing level meta commentary sets film apart typical superhero fare despite comedic approach film skimp emotional depth storyline carried genuine heart particularly addresses themes redemption friendship climax especially impactful ranking among greats franchise good sequel game changer mcu film successfully integrates deadpool broader marvel cinematic universe maintaining unique tone style sets stage future installments promising exciting developments ahead way film navigates transitions feels seamless ensuring deadpool irreverent humor clash mcu established tone overall deadpool wolverine standout entry mcu offering perfect blend humor action heart ryan reynolds hugh jackman deliver top notch performances supported smart script deft direction shawn levy film redeems past missteps franchise also paves way promising future must watch marvel fan filled laughter thrills touching moments elevate many predecessors,Negative

Deadpool & Wolverine,Action,"Finally, the moment I have been eagerly waiting for has arrived - the new film featuring Deadpool and Wolverine! I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this without revealing any spoilers, so brace yourself for a fairly tame review to keep the surprise intact for everyone.

Marvel is back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.

The dance sequence is a hilarious throwback to the 90s, adding a touch of nostalgia and charm to the film. And yes, there is plenty of colorful language, including an abundance of the infamous F word - but then again, what else would you expect from Deadpool?

Prepare to be amazed by some incredible cameos that will leave you jumping out of your seat with excitement, especially if you have a soft spot for certain characters from the past. This movie is an absolute thrill ride that pays homage to the Fox universe and its beloved characters.

Without giving too much away, there is a surprising appearance by a fan-favorite character who never made it to the superhero league, and the moment is truly jaw-dropping. The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.

While the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.

If you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. 

Overall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable Marvel experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss.

Deadpool & Wolverine,Action,"**Deadpool & Wolverine: A Comic Book Dream Realized**

From the very beginning, _Deadpool & Wolverine_ bursts onto the screen with the chaotic energy and irreverent humor fans have come to expect from the Merc with a Mouth. This film feels like a love letter to comic book enthusiasts, seamlessly blending the zany, fourth-wall-breaking antics of Deadpool with the gritty, emotionally charged presence of Wolverine. The movie captures the essence of reading a comic book, where big, crazy choices and wild action sequences keep you at the edge of your seat. The introduction of variants and a plethora of cameos from beloved characters across the Marvel Universe only enhances this feeling, making it a true spectacle for long-time fans.

Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is nothing short of iconic, and this film allows him to fully embrace the character in ways we’ve longed to see. The sight of Wolverine finally donning his classic costume and charging on all fours is a visual treat that elicited cheers from the audience. Jackman’s performance is a testament to his deep connection with the character, proving once again why he's considered one of the best actors of our time.

Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is as quippy and meta as ever, and the film strikes a delicate balance between humor and heart. The emotional depth is surprising, particularly in scenes where _Deadpool and Wolverine_ share poignant moments. One standout is Deadpool's farewell to Wolverine, which is both a nod to the characters' shared history and a poignant reminder of their enduring bond.

The film's action sequences are top-tier, with choreography that respects each character's unique fighting style. The inclusion of characters like Elektra, Blade, and even a hilarious cameo from Gambit adds layers of excitement and nostalgia. Wesley Snipes' return as Blade, complete with his signature line, ""Some motherfuckers always trying to ice-skate uphill,"" received one of the loudest reactions from the audience.

The story navigates the complexities of timelines and multiverse mechanics with a wink and a nod, never bogging down in overly technical explanations. This approach keeps the focus on the characters and their journeys, making for a more engaging and enjoyable experience.

_Deadpool & Wolverine_ isn't just a comic book movie; it's a celebration of the Marvel Universe's rich history and a heartfelt send-off to characters we've grown to love over the years. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a casual viewer, this film is an emotional whirlwind that invokes nostalgia and opens your heart to the possibilities you imagined as a kid. It's a fitting tribute to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and a testament to the enduring appeal of Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool. This movie is sure to be remembered as one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a true comic book dream realized on the big screen.",deadpool wolverine comic book dream realized beginning deadpool wolverine bursts onto screen chaotic energy irreverent humor fans come expect merc mouth film feels like love letter comic book enthusiasts seamlessly blending zany fourth wall breaking antics deadpool gritty emotionally charged presence wolverine movie captures essence reading comic book big crazy choices wild action sequences keep edge seat introduction variants plethora cameos beloved characters across marvel universe enhances feeling making true spectacle long time fans hugh jackman portrayal wolverine nothing short iconic film allows fully embrace character ways longed see sight wolverine finally donning classic costume charging fours visual treat elicited cheers audience jackman performance testament deep connection character proving considered one best actors time ryan reynolds deadpool quippy meta ever film strikes delicate balance humor heart emotional depth surprising particularly scenes deadpool wolverine share poignant moments one standout deadpool farewell wolverine nod characters shared history poignant reminder enduring bond film action sequences top tier choreography respects character unique fighting style inclusion characters like elektra blade even hilarious cameo gambit adds layers excitement nostalgia wesley snipes return blade complete signature line motherfuckers always trying ice skate uphill received one loudest reactions audience story navigates complexities timelines multiverse mechanics wink nod never bogging overly technical explanations approach keeps focus characters journeys making engaging enjoyable experience deadpool wolverine comic book movie celebration marvel universe rich history heartfelt send characters grown love years whether die hard fan casual viewer film emotional whirlwind invokes nostalgia opens heart possibilities imagined kid fitting tribute hugh jackman wolverine testament enduring appeal ryan reynolds deadpool movie sure remembered one best marvel cinematic universe true comic book dream realized big screen,Negative
How to Train Your Dragon 2,Action,"If you loved the first How to Train Your Dragon, you'll absolutely love this movie. If you are a frequent user of Tumblr, you'll want to capture SO many moments in .gif format. If you've never seen the first movie, you'll still love this movie, or at least, like it.

Essentially, this movie is great. It has all that a child could desire in a film (trust me, the kids in the theatre LOVED it - it was super cute) and it also had some absolutely hilarious moments for the adults. The plot is pretty good; even if it is predictable, it's predictable in a way that works. The animation is gorgeous. The voicework is awesome. The way all of the characters have grown over the 5 year gap between the two movies in the series was really well done and evident, not just in appearance, but also in their personalities and interactions with each other.

How to Train Your Dragon 2,Action,"Like I said a couple of year ago during 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2' review, it's a terrible title for a sequel. The host, Neil Patrick also said the same thing during the 2015 Oscars. But in the digital world, slight change in the title makes random in order. I mean on the computer and web world, it won't show in order. Even sometime it might get lost in a vast number of other titles if they dare to chance the first word in the title for a sequel. Other than that they are not stupid as many people think. That's why they highlighted 'Dragon' boldly than the rest of the words.

This part two was not much different to its first. The story continues five years after Hiccup recovers from his injury. He and his pet, Toothless discovers a new land during the survey for the map. So their's adventure begins, but end in a trouble and forces all his people from the town to involve and fight against the rising evil force that tries to conquer them all.

Like I always say, those days are gone, now animated movies are for all ages. This was a very nicely and carefully written screenplay, did not fail to deliver. Very close to the impact the first movie made, but due to simplicity it stayed a couple of steps behind. Developed well with a bit of suspense, thrill and entertainment. Nothing more we could have asked, a perfect follow-up and hoping to explore beyond lot more in the upcoming movies in this series. Four years gap between the movies is a nice idea and fine breathing space for this franchise fan. A movie must be seen by animation fans, especially if you have already seen the first then don't miss it.

How to Train Your Dragon 2,Action,"The first one was good and the second is not any worse.

This series is standing out of the pack for its complex plot involving several topics, not just the typical ones in an animated movie. Arguably, they have been also treated in former movies; two main characters which are crippled (Finding Nemo ...), greater involvement of strong female roles (although, still, not as main characters and utterly in need of help from the male roles), ecology, etc.

The points I dislike the most is the speech of homeland being the good ""peacekeeper"" nation forced to use violence to keep it (peace). Quite hypocritical but, clearly, addressed to the US audience.

The repetitive line of story about the (nerd) hero who is the only one to save the world is quite tiresome too.

Finally, how lightly some other traumatic causing topics are treated: finding that a parent abandoned their child, death, etc ...

""Lilo & Stitch is one of Disney's most adorable, emotionally sincere live-action remakes to date.

Lilo & Stitch,Comedy,"Hmmm! I wasn’t sure if I was watching a sentimental edition of “Hawaii Five-O” here or a collection of outtakes from a “Sonic” movie as this rather disappointingly trundles along for the guts of two hours. It’s starts off quite promisingly as we see the “Grand Councilwoman” sentence the latest creation of madcap scientist “Jumba” to exile under the supervision of himself and Earth expert “Pleakley”. It turns out that the eponymous blue critter is actually quite a malevolent beastie adept at causing no end of mischief, and with the authorities now on his tail, he concludes that the safest thing to do is to hide in plain sight and get him self adopted by the none-too-bright “Lilo” (Maia Kealoha) who actually thinks he’s a dog! What is even dafter is that her elder sister “Nani” (Sydney Agudong) also reckons there is nothing so abnormal about a lively blue pet that can enunciate - though that’s perhaps because she is dazzled by the affections of the beefcake poster boy next door “David” (the hilariously wooden Kaipo Dudoit). Anyway, that’s the scene set as the predicable character arcs take us on a journey from bereavement and rebelliousness to the certainty of it’s long-in-coming denouement. It has it’s Laurel and Hardy moments, and at times there is some very light comedy - usually from Billy Magnussen, but I’m afraid that the story hasn’t the courage of it’s initially mischievous convictions and I rather lost interest as a sea of sentiment washed over me. Maybe it needs a “Brightburn” style director’s cut to spice it up a bit, but as it is it is an ok watch for the kids but not much more.",hmmm sure watching sentimental edition hawaii five collection outtakes sonic movie rather disappointingly trundles along guts two hours starts quite promisingly see grand councilwoman sentence latest creation madcap scientist jumba exile supervision earth expert pleakley turns eponymous blue critter actually quite malevolent beastie adept causing end mischief authorities tail concludes safest thing hide plain sight get self adopted none bright lilo maia kealoha actually thinks dog even dafter elder sister nani sydney agudong also reckons nothing abnormal lively blue pet enunciate though perhaps dazzled affections beefcake poster boy next door david hilariously wooden kaipo dudoit anyway scene set predicable character arcs take us journey bereavement rebelliousness certainty long coming denouement laurel hardy moments times light comedy usually billy magnussen afraid story courage initially mischievous convictions rather lost interest sea sentiment washed maybe needs brightburn style director cut spice bit ok watch kids much,Negative
Lilo & Stitch,Comedy,"While watching Disney’s new live-action version of Lilo & Stitch, the film felt fairly accurate to the original 2002 animated film for the first half of the film while the second half seemed insanely different in comparison. However, upon revisiting the original film, the live-action version features many unwanted modifications.

Pleakley and Jumba are butchered in the new film. Now played by Billy Magnussen and Zach Galifianakis respectively both spend the majority of the film as humans (they use alien technology to mimic humans early in the film). This was likely done as a cost-cutting measure, especially after the opening of the film is all CGI, but it’s awkward. Lilo & Stitch was originally meant as a Disney+ exclusive and has the lowest budget ($100 million) of any Disney live-action remake since Cruella.

Magnussen at least has the same personality and a similar voice to Kevin McDonald’s in the original film. The new film turns Jumba into the main villain and strips the character of his Russian accent. In the original film, Jumba is hunting Stitch up until the point where Stitch simply asks Jumba to help him which he abides by.

As humans, both Magnussen and Galifianakis seem to be wearing false teeth or something as they both have overbites that completely alter their speech. It gives the characters this uncanny valley appearance that is way more unsettling than it should be.

Cobra Bubbles is no longer a former CIA agent turned CPS social worker. He’s now just a CIA agent with no personality whatsoever. Courtney B. Vance portrays Bubbles in the film and while his acting skills are fine his frame isn’t big enough. Oddly, Disney is currently hiring actors who never saw the original film for their remakes though. Galifianakis didn’t even know who Jumba was while Courtney B. Vance didn’t watch the film because Stitch scared his kids. It’s no wonder their performances aren’t satisfying.

The new film splits the Bubbles character into two characters. Bubbles is a straightforward CIA agent while Tia Carrere (the original voice of Nani) portrays the CPS social worker and is essentially all of the softer and kinder aspects that made Bubbles interesting. She manifests what made Bubbles interesting, but is otherwise a bit flat while trying to be a worthwhile character on her own.

Lilo and Nani now have neighbors who are also part of their Ohana. The film strips David of whatever charm he may have had in the animated film. Kaipo Dudoi portrays him as a bumbling idiot who can’t talk or put a sentence together to save his life. His grandma Tutu (Amy Hill) is almost never in the film without riding her 4-wheeler. She takes Lilo to the pound to pick up Stitch behind Nani’s back whereas it was Nani’s idea in the animated film.

Some big alterations come in the form of both Lilo and Stitch. Lilo lashed out in the animated film but had a vivid imagination. In the new film, Maia Kealoha has the right voice and mannerisms, but the way she is written injects all of the obnoxious behavior of her character and none of what makes her interesting.

In the 2002 film, Stitch doesn’t say more than three or four words at a time until the ending where he asks to say goodbye and talks about his little and broken family still being good. Most of his dialogue is his alien language and various catchphrases. He begins talking in full sentences halfway into the live-action film. There are also no cute and fluffy jokes, which is a crime in itself.

The new film erases Stitch’s infatuation with The Ugly Duckling, which feels like a huge story shift. Stitch learns what family is and learns that he doesn’t have parents because he was made in a lab and not born naturally. He relates to The Ugly Duckling because he wants to be a part of a family. A family he never had can’t come pick him up or make him feel better, so he finds his own.

There’s also this new concept of Stitch getting heavier the longer he’s in the water. This new story element will obviously factor into how things unfold later in the film, but Stitch didn’t like water originally and couldn’t swim. For possessing “enhanced intellect,” deciding to go into the water when you can’t swim and because you’ll likely never reach the surface again if you fall in seems dumb.

The other differences are mostly little ones that are still bothersome. There’s less of an emphasis on Elvis and his music, Stitch loses his red alien clothes after he’s run over in the animated film whereas he just kind of lands naked in the live-action one, he adores cake in the live-action film whereas he takes one bite and then spits it back up whole in the animated, there’s no coin-operated spaceship sequence or Stitch getting into the laundry and wearing a bra on his head and a towel like a cape to look like a superhero, and he hijacks a Power Wheels in the new film instead of a Big Wheel.

The film looks fairly good, as all of the animated characters transitioned to live-action rather seamlessly. All of the Stitch sequences are great. Stitch's interactions with Lilo are still fun. The sequences with Jumba’s portal gun are some of the best in the live-action film. As a huge fan of the original film, this remake suffers from feeling unnecessary, especially since Stitch is still one of the most popular Disney characters.

Lilo & Stitch is a watchable live-action Disney remake with some entertaining moments, but its knack for revising half of what made the animated version memorable and molding it into something more mediocre is baffling.",watching disney new live action version lilo stitch film felt fairly accurate original animated film first half film second half seemed insanely different comparison however upon revisiting original film live action version features many unwanted modifications pleakley jumba butchered new film played billy magnussen zach galifianakis respectively spend majority film humans use alien technology mimic humans early film likely done cost cutting measure especially opening film cgi awkward lilo stitch originally meant disney exclusive lowest budget million disney live action remake since cruella magnussen least personality similar voice kevin mcdonald original film new film turns jumba main villain strips character russian accent original film jumba hunting stitch point stitch simply asks jumba help abides humans magnussen galifianakis seem wearing false teeth something overbites completely alter speech gives characters uncanny valley appearance way unsettling cobra bubbles longer former cia agent turned cps social worker cia agent personality whatsoever courtney b vance portrays bubbles film acting skills fine frame big enough oddly disney currently hiring actors never saw original film remakes though galifianakis even know jumba courtney b vance watch film stitch scared kids wonder performances satisfying new film splits bubbles character two characters bubbles straightforward cia agent tia carrere original voice nani portrays cps social worker essentially softer kinder aspects made bubbles interesting manifests made bubbles interesting otherwise bit flat trying worthwhile character lilo nani neighbors also part ohana film strips david whatever charm may animated film kaipo dudoi portrays bumbling idiot talk put sentence together save life grandma tutu amy hill almost never film without riding wheeler takes lilo pound pick stitch behind nani back whereas nani idea animated film big alterations come form lilo stitch lilo lashed animated film vivid imagination new film maia kealoha right voice mannerisms way written injects obnoxious behavior character none makes interesting film stitch say three four words time ending asks say goodbye talks little broken family still good dialogue alien language various catchphrases begins talking full sentences halfway live action film also cute fluffy jokes crime new film erases stitch infatuation ugly duckling feels like huge story shift stitch learns family learns parents made lab born naturally relates ugly duckling wants part family family never come pick make feel better finds also new concept stitch getting heavier longer water new story element obviously factor things unfold later film stitch like water originally swim possessing enhanced intellect deciding go water swim likely never reach surface fall seems dumb differences mostly little ones still bothersome less emphasis elvis music stitch loses red alien clothes run animated film whereas kind lands naked live action one adores cake live action film whereas takes one bite spits back whole animated coin operated spaceship sequence stitch getting laundry wearing bra head towel like cape look like superhero hijacks power wheels new film instead big wheel film looks fairly good animated characters transitioned live action rather seamlessly stitch sequences great stitch interactions lilo still fun sequences jumba portal gun best live action film huge fan original film remake suffers feeling unnecessary especially since stitch still one popular disney characters lilo stitch watchable live action disney remake entertaining moments knack revising half made animated version memorable molding something mediocre baffling,Negative

KPop Demon Hunters,Comedy,"I enjoyed this movie, but boy do I have issues with the storytelling and the glamorizing of K-pop idols' lives.

SPOILERS AHEAD:

1. Rumi was born part-demon, right? Her mother was a demon hunter and her father was a demon, which implies that not all demons are evil, right? Yes? No? We are never told how Rumi's mother died and we are never told what happened to Rumi's father, but I highly doubt that Rumi's mother was tricked into a relationship by a demon long enough to have a child.
2. All demons are supposed to be banished when the Honmoon is sealed, so how the heck is the cat and the crow still there, also, why do we even have a demon cat and crow? They're cute, but what are they? Are there ""true demons"" like Gwi-Ma, the cat and the crow, and ""enslaved demons"" like Jinu and his boy band?
3. Gwi-Ma enslaves other demons and practically tortures them with their shame for all eternity and we end the movie by permanently trapping them all in the demon realm with him? Really? Even though Jinu shows that demons can be redeemed by... showing them kindness and forgiveness?! REALLY?! Okay!

The last one is my biggest issue with the plot.

As for my issues with the representation of K-pop idols; their lives are only glamorous on the surface. K-pop idols are not born, they're made.

These kids go through hell, for lack of a better way to describe it. It's not so much an issue with the K-pop industry itself, as it's a ""cultural"" issue. Koreans push themselves and each other to the brink, and it can and does lead to suicide.

South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world.

The movie shows our K-pop protagonists snacking out and enjoying life, when in reality, these kids are on a strict diet and are allegedly not allowed these things.

Heads of State,Comedy,"""Heads of State"" functions as a basic ""buddy"" team up, comedy action flick but its not without its limitations.

Lets start with the positives. Idris Elba and John Cena are perfect choices for this kind of film. Ones loud, a showman, in the role of the US president. The other's more grounded and somewhat acerbic, as the UK Prime Minister. The interplay between the two works well, moving from mutual disdain, to at times grudging, respect and even friendship, of a kind. 

The action is well paced too, it keeps coming with a little mostly light drama, in between, so you can catch your breath. 

Now to the downside. They can play this any way they like but its hard not to see elements of pro US/UK political and military propaganda, in operation. NATO are heavily pushed as the ""good guys"", taking on ""bullies"". Well tell that to the former Yugoslavia NATO bombed into the ground and ultimately, destroyed. Its unsurprising too, that the ""baddies""are portrayed as Russian. 

In summary, if you step past the plug for US/UK exceptionalism there is a functional comedy action flick on offer, that's moderately watchable but by no means special.",heads state functions basic buddy team comedy action flick without limitations lets start positives idris elba john cena perfect choices kind film ones loud showman role us president grounded somewhat acerbic uk prime minister interplay two works well moving mutual disdain times grudging respect even friendship kind action well paced keeps coming little mostly light drama catch breath downside play way like hard see elements pro us uk political military propaganda operation nato heavily pushed good guys taking bullies well tell former yugoslavia nato bombed ground ultimately destroyed unsurprising baddies portrayed russian summary step past plug us uk exceptionalism functional comedy action flick offer moderately watchable means special,Negative
Heads of State,Comedy,"<em>'Heads of State'</em> holds positives and negatives, for me. For the opening half of the movie, I was not feeling it. It just all felt so plain, stale and quite grating, to be honest. To my surprise, though, it actually improved as it went on. By the end, I think it actually won me over.

One element that was keeping my interest, even amongst the aforementioned slow initial chunk, was the cast. I like Idris Elba, I like John Cena. Therefore, I had just enough in me to keep my eyes on the screen. Their banter is a bit forced, but does become effective eventually.

Priyanka Chopra is pretty good, plenty of satisfactory action from her; that recap edit is amusingly done, to be fair. Jack Quaid's bit is fun, while Paddy Considine, Stephen Root and Carla Gugino are decent actors to compensate for otherwise quite lame characters.

If not for those named, I'd be rating this a lot lower. Still, there are some strong moments and cool shots in there, like the apartment staircase and the lost tooth moment. Annoyingly, there is a fair amount wrong too; for example, the special effects are absolutely not good.

A Minecraft Movie,Comedy,"Alright, buckle up, because I just saw a movie that completely blew my mind! Seriously, I'm still buzzing. From the very first scene, I was absolutely hooked, and it didn't let go until the credits rolled.

The story? Oh my gosh, the story! It was so clever and well-crafted. It had twists and turns I never saw coming, but it all made perfect sense in the end. It was like a puzzle that slowly came together, and every piece was perfectly placed. You know when a movie makes you think? This one definitely did that. It wasn't just mindless action or fluff; it had real substance.

And the characters! They were so real and relatable. I felt like I knew them, like I was right there with them on their journey. They had depth, they had flaws, they had moments that made me laugh, and moments that made me want to cry. I was completely invested in what happened to them. The actors did an amazing job bringing them to life. You could feel their emotions through the screen.

Visually, it was stunning. The way it was shot, the colors, the sets – everything was just beautiful. It wasn't just pretty to look at, though; it also added to the story and the mood. Some scenes were so powerful, they'll stay with me for a long time. The music was also perfect! It really enhanced the emotions and made everything even more impactful.

Honestly, I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about this movie. It had everything: a great story, amazing characters, beautiful visuals, and a fantastic soundtrack.

A Minecraft Movie,Comedy,"Who doesn’t like a white woolly llama? Well that’s probably the highlight of this derivative CGI-fest that finds a quartet of geeks and gamers dragged through a magical portal to a world ruled by the evil “Malgosha”. Now she wants to use this glowing cube to escape from her dark and dingy “Overworld” realm and take over the peaceable and colourful real-world but she hasn’t banked on the tenacity of former gaming champion “Garrett” (Jason Momoa) and the geeky “Henry” (Sebastian Hansen) who reunite with the long trapped “Steve” (Jack Black) to save the day and the world. You don’t really need to know much about the video game to appreciate the simplicity of this, but then again I’m note sure you’d need to be much over 5 to appreciate it either. The visuals are engagingly 1980s with some references that did remind me a bit of “Back to the Future” (1985) meets “Dungeons & Dragons” and a decent soundtrack that allows Black to get straight into his element and prove that it is possible to entertain amidst what was undoubtedly (for him) a sea of green!

I was really disappointed by the movie and I was even more surprised that Jack Black agreed to take on such a role It just didn’t fit him at all and it honestly brought down his image in my eyes.

Moana 2,Comedy,"When ""Moana"" learns that the whole of Pacific Island society is under a curse from the powerful god ""Nalo"", she has to recruit a few faithful crew members and go seek out ""Maui"" before she can find the long lost and sunken island of ""Morefutu"". Once there, she hopes to break the malevolent force that has, for centuries, ensured that her people never manage to make contact with any others - despite her finding evidence that they did exist - somewhere, once upon a time! Of course there's ""Heihei"" the chicken and ""Pua"" the pig, but she's gonna need more help than that so up steps pin-up ""Moni"", the knife-wielding engineer ""Loto"" and the glass-half-empty farmer ""Keke"" and off they go. Loads of escapades await them as they again encounter their poisoned-dart firing coconut warriors - the ""Kakamora"", a giant clam and, of course, the winds and the seas as the mischievous ""Matangi"" and her army of bats tries to make life as difficult as they can. Luckily, ""Matangi"" has also had a run-in with ""Maui"" and so maybe they can all unite now, but can his giant hook and his tattoos empower him to help her to defeat their powerful nemesis? Well, what do you think? Thing is, we're not watching this for any jeopardy or menace from the storyline, we are watching it for the fun characterisations and the engaging dynamic between the eponymous girl and her super-strength demigod. That, sadly, is sadly lacking in this disappointing sequel. The visual effects are super, and the pace of the adventure likewise - but the story is just too thin and the arrival of the new characters doesn't really compensate as it rather procedurally, if colourfully, meanders along without really delving into and exploiting the fantastic depths of culture and mythology at it's disposal. The soundtrack is also nowhere near as catchy, and even though some of the lyrics are quite entertaining, the film lacks a killer song for either leading character. Sure, we've the power ballad ""Beyond"" and ""Maui"" gets the quirky ""Can I Get a Chee Chee"", but they lack the charming silliness of Lin Manuel Miranda's efforts from eight years ago. It's all perfectly watchable, and ought to be seen on a big screen to show off the creatively detailed animation, but I reckon it's entirely forgettable and will probably just serve as a stepping stone to the next one which is certain to follow just as seagulls follow fishing boats.",moana learns whole pacific island society curse powerful god nalo recruit faithful crew members go seek maui find long lost sunken island morefutu hopes break malevolent force centuries ensured people never manage make contact others despite finding evidence exist somewhere upon time course heihei chicken pua pig gon na need help steps pin moni knife wielding engineer loto glass half empty farmer keke go loads escapades await encounter poisoned dart firing coconut warriors kakamora giant clam course winds seas mischievous matangi army bats tries make life difficult luckily matangi also run maui maybe unite giant hook tattoos empower help defeat powerful nemesis well think thing watching jeopardy menace storyline watching fun characterisations engaging dynamic eponymous girl super strength demigod sadly sadly lacking disappointing sequel visual effects super pace adventure likewise story thin arrival new characters really compensate rather procedurally colourfully meanders along without really delving exploiting fantastic depths culture mythology disposal soundtrack also nowhere near catchy even though lyrics quite entertaining film lacks killer song either leading character sure power ballad beyond maui gets quirky get chee chee lack charming silliness lin manuel miranda efforts eight years ago perfectly watchable ought seen big screen show creatively detailed animation reckon entirely forgettable probably serve stepping stone next one certain follow seagulls follow fishing boats,Negative

Sonic the Hedgehog 3,Comedy,"So for fifty years, ""GUN"" have kept ""Shadow"" in a gloopy state of stasis deep underground in a top secret facility. All of a sudden he awakens, punches himself out of the place and that means that the director (Krysten Ritter) has to disrupt a family barbecue to engage the services of ""Team Sonic"". Our eponymous blue hedgehog, his best pals ""Tails"" and ""Knuckles"" have settled down to a peaceable life with ""Tom"" (James Marsden) and ""Maddie"" (Tika Sumpter) but realise they have to rise to the occasion so off they go. Imagine their shock, though, when they discover that their new super-fast and super-strong nemesis is another (not quite so blue) hedgehog! Who is he? What's going on? Why does he seem to loath mankind, so? Well that all becomes clear when his puppet-master turns out to be the grand-daddy of all baddies. The ultimate ""Robotnik"" - only with a slightly more rotund belly. Matched, even out-matched, it falls to our intrepid team to try and form an alliance of their own, but how will that endure in the face of such terrible odds? Well don't go looking for any jeopardy here, indeed what starts off as quite a fun series of thwack and pow escapades showing off the skills of the rivals cannot resist turning into the cul-de-sac of sentimentality as the inevitable plot lines grab hold of the characters and turn them into cheesy mush. I always like a good antagonist, but sadly we just know that however dastardly and evil he - in this case the ultra-hammy Jim Carrey - can be, no writer or director is ever going to let him win, and that's pretty efficiently telegraphed right from the start of this sequel that's going to be a prequel too, no doubt. Some of the writing is quite fun, with plenty of contemporary and quite sarcastic references to raise a smile, and there are homages paid aplenty to just about everyone from ""007"" and the ""Fantastic Four"" to the ""Avengers"" - but in the end it's all just a little too shiny and predicable.

Inside Out 2,Comedy,"The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with “Inside Out 2” which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.

The movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).

Their success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.

Things take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.

Riley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.

The new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.

Forced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley’s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.

The movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.

The film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.

Inside Out 2,Comedy,"I really quite enjoyed the first of these (2015) but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one. ""Riley"" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like ""Fear"", ""Joy"" and ""Anger"" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. ""Anger"" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic ""Ennui"" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in.

Inside Out 2,Comedy,"Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix!

Inside Out 2,Comedy,"When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar’s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar’s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.

I can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.

The sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke’s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler’s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.

The story’s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.

Some interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. 

Amy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke’s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn’t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children’s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.

Inside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.

If you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley’s journey. It’s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",first heard sequel inside approached mix excitement apprehension original film masterpiece one pixar finest achievements seamlessly blending humor emotion profound understanding human psychology given pixar recent uneven track record feared sequel might live high standards set predecessor however delighted report case confidently say inside worthy successor original almost reaches level excellence taking story fresh direction new cast characters enrich narrative sequel introduces beautifully nuanced character anxiety portrayed maya hawke hawke performance brings sympathetic depth role making anxiety character audiences relate care character adds layer complexity story resonates multiple levels anxiety interactions joy played masterfully amy poehler highlight inevitable struggles growing poehler joy continues heart film story emotional core remains powerful ever father original film spoke deeply understanding acknowledging children emotions extension sequel shifts focus inward reflecting internal emotional landscape adolescence early adulthood riley protagonist growing introduction complex emotions reflects reality development film brilliantly captures awkwardness discomfort transition making relatable younger audiences adults interactions film cringe worthy true life experienced moments anxiety self doubt seeing portrayed authentically screen uncomfortable cathartic amy poehler portrayal joy remains highlight maya hawke anxiety beautifully crafted antagonist evolves throughout film end anxiety source conflict character facilitates growth understanding development adds depth narrative making children film profound exploration emotional growth inside summer movie stands high point family entertainment balances humor emotion storyline speaks children adults pixar delivered film entertains also enlightens reminding us importance understanding embracing emotions anyone loved first film sequel must watch capturing magic exploring new emotional territory cherished original insightful portrayal emotions find inside worthy enriching continuation riley journey film promises hit families valuable conversation starter complex world emotions,Negative
Inside Out 2,Comedy,"""Inside Out 2"" brilliantly follows up its predecessor with a heartwarming and deeply insightful exploration of the human mind. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions, creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.

The return of our beloved emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley's inner world.

Inside Out 2,Comedy,"Inside Out 2 is a suggestion to follow Riley’s troubles during adolescence, which adds new characters to this animated movie – Anxiety and Envy, – besides Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Both animation and voice acting are great, and the animation properly shows the confusion and disorder of a teenage girl’s mind. Compared to ‘Toy Story 2,’ it may not be as rich in genuine sentiment, but it returns all viewers, children, and adults, to the challenge of the act of growing up.

I also enjoyed the comedy and the themes present in it and maybe because of the continuous showings or better comprehension of it allowed me to have less of a feeling compare to the first one although at some parts it is sort of teary. It was interesting to see how Joy and Anxiety interacted with each other these characters are more real in terms of showing us how emotions work during decision-making when you’re in trouble.

Deadpool & Wolverine,Comedy,"Its story may not be the strongest, but the comedy makes <em>'Deadpool & Wolverine'</em> an excellent watch!

There are some top notch gags in there, particularly to do with the recent offscreen changes for Wade Wilson's alter ego. As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.

Reynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.

Deadpool & Wolverine,Comedy,"In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom’s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering’s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy’s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don’t. I suppose that’s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren’t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture’s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise’s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn’t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I’d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",moviemaking sadly problem going well many times latest installment one filmdom better cinematic franchises verges proving offering predecessors significantly distinguished kind fare typically found superhero genre outrageously bawdy humor hilarious sight gags relentlessly maverick attitude time however director shawn levy latest effort decidedly hit miss affair often incoherent script feels like cobbled together collection leftover parts work suppose entirely surprising screenplay penned four different writers making wonder much consensus place compiling finished product moreover film appears intended fold deadpool franchise x men franchise intriguing idea regrettably handled rather clumsily often case many recent fusion offerings marvel universe bad enough release gives short shrift colorful cast supporting players made deadpool films funny original enjoyable relegating little cameos favor walk ons host mcu characters remarkably obscure might add attempt help cement franchise cross pollination going makes awkward storytelling times especially viewers might familiar lesser known figures drawn marvel source material unrelated big screen offerings picture credit features yet another stellar turn ryan reynolds color protagonist well share hilarious bits without doubt franchise historically strongest suit including number unabashed razor sharp asides referencing screen developments related studios produced films actors appeared strengths notwithstanding however production sadly watered elements best made franchise work favor overarching programming agenda simply serve film series particularly well creators would served viewers better sticking works basics good storytelling trying force issue sake future productions may may work long term noticeable downfall quality many recent marvel universe releases truly hate see franchise befall similar fate,Negative

Deadpool & Wolverine,Comedy,"Well the ""Deadpool"" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old ""Dead"". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed ""Wolverine/Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing ""Paradox"" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down ""Cassandra Nova"" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of ""Xavier"" who presides over the void. That's a ""Mad Max"" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by ""Paradox"" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",well deadpool concept well truly immersed marvel multi verse really fear good old dead well actually ryan reynolds reverted occasionally quite vulgar humour first film allowed trequel focus personality irreverent immortal superhero tries resurrect recently departed wolverine logan hugh jackman save timeline erasure thwart comically menacing paradox matthew macfadyen face cassandra nova emma corrin happens long estranged twin sister xavier presides void mad max style desert style territory undesirables put paradox organisation years initially love lost two heroes cocky man red lycra impress new booze soaked guilt ridden buddy quickly manage align priorities well yes guess rest indeed nothing remotely unpredictable shout loudly proudly knows trying reinvent wheel succeeding pointing multi verse films simply adjust space time continuum provide new setting old stories ad characters stop audience bore repetitive combat cycles nondescript plot lines maybe reynolds egg smuttiness little still plenty wry comments industry product placement plethora films actors preceded delivering old old forgotten entertain us loads action scenes amiable chemistry two actors clearly suitably sarcastic page throughout two hours also features fun cameos likes messrs evans snipes cavill favreau tatum keep moving along effervescence spirit big screen essential lot effort gone production work well telly enjoyed,Negative
Deadpool & Wolverine,Comedy,"Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.

Reynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film’s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman’s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it’s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.

The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film’s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.

The film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.

Despite its comedic approach, the film doesn’t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.

This isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool’s irreverent humor doesn’t clash with the MCU’s established tone.

Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It’s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",deadpool wolverine movie truly believe marvel cinematic universe mcu needed years lackluster installments film breath fresh air ryan reynolds hugh jackman director shawn levy approached project care deep understanding fans want film feels like crafted fans fans particularly frustrated recent phases mcu reynolds levy brought team writers strong background comedy storytelling decision pays film humor narrative sharp engaging example meta vibe deadpool familiar previous two films ramped significantly movie spares one making jokes everything hugh jackman recent divorce ryan reynolds career however mcu receives pointed critical jokes resonate long time fans chemistry reynolds jackman electric bringing new life characters dynamic hilarious heartfelt making compelling narrative instance scenes deadpool wolverine banter taking enemies filled wit energy showcasing unique bond camaraderie extends film supporting cast well timed cameos clever nods previous marvel movies film self awareness willingness poke fun franchise refreshing level meta commentary sets film apart typical superhero fare despite comedic approach film skimp emotional depth storyline carried genuine heart particularly addresses themes redemption friendship climax especially impactful ranking among greats franchise good sequel game changer mcu film successfully integrates deadpool broader marvel cinematic universe maintaining unique tone style sets stage future installments promising exciting developments ahead way film navigates transitions feels seamless ensuring deadpool irreverent humor clash mcu established tone overall deadpool wolverine standout entry mcu offering perfect blend humor action heart ryan reynolds hugh jackman deliver top notch performances supported smart script deft direction shawn levy film redeems past missteps franchise also paves way promising future must watch marvel fan filled laughter thrills touching moments elevate many predecessors,Negative
Deadpool & Wolverine,Comedy,"It feels a bit rushed... but then it was rushed.  It feels a bit neutered, but it's now Disney and they did muzzle it.

The thing is though... it's not woke, which is why you have articles criticizing it for ""Not Being Gay Enough"" and in 2024, that very literally translates to: ""They focused on a story and characters rather than a political agenda and we're mad about it."" Which, in turn, translates to ""Actually entertaining.""

But... who cares, it literally doesn't have a point other than entertaining you, and that is really all that matters and all that I ask for.

Is it a cash grab? Yes, and I will GLADLY give them my money for another movie that just wants to entertain.  And if they make another movie that wants to entertain and not push an agenda, I will gladly give them MORE of my money... because at the end of the day, entertainment has been in a decade long drought brought to you by political lecturing and nerd domains have been intentionally attacking fans rather than making movies, like this, that make fans want to give them their money.

If you've seen a lot of previous Marvel films in this universe, you will be treated with an abundance of fan service. Admittedly, I have not watched a lot of these films. I have, however, watched the first two Deadpool entries. I enjoyed them at the time, especially the first one.

In this third entry, you will find a lot of cameos which are absolutely pointless, except for people to chug memberberries, as they do absolutely nothing with these characters. It doesn't even properly show the backstory of Wolverine.

Deadpool & Wolverine,Comedy,"Finally, the moment I have been eagerly waiting for has arrived - the new film featuring Deadpool and Wolverine! I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this without revealing any spoilers, so brace yourself for a fairly tame review to keep the surprise intact for everyone.

Marvel is back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.

The dance sequence is a hilarious throwback to the 90s, adding a touch of nostalgia and charm to the film. And yes, there is plenty of colorful language, including an abundance of the infamous F word - but then again, what else would you expect from Deadpool?

Prepare to be amazed by some incredible cameos that will leave you jumping out of your seat with excitement, especially if you have a soft spot for certain characters from the past. This movie is an absolute thrill ride that pays homage to the Fox universe and its beloved characters.

Without giving too much away, there is a surprising appearance by a fan-favorite character who never made it to the superhero league, and the moment is truly jaw-dropping. The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.

While the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.

If you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. 

Overall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable Marvel experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss.

From the very beginning, _Deadpool & Wolverine_ bursts onto the screen with the chaotic energy and irreverent humor fans have come to expect from the Merc with a Mouth. This film feels like a love letter to comic book enthusiasts, seamlessly blending the zany, fourth-wall-breaking antics of Deadpool with the gritty, emotionally charged presence of Wolverine. The movie captures the essence of reading a comic book, where big, crazy choices and wild action sequences keep you at the edge of your seat. The introduction of variants and a plethora of cameos from beloved characters across the Marvel Universe only enhances this feeling, making it a true spectacle for long-time fans.

Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is nothing short of iconic, and this film allows him to fully embrace the character in ways we’ve longed to see. The sight of Wolverine finally donning his classic costume and charging on all fours is a visual treat that elicited cheers from the audience. Jackman’s performance is a testament to his deep connection with the character, proving once again why he's considered one of the best actors of our time.

Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is as quippy and meta as ever, and the film strikes a delicate balance between humor and heart. The emotional depth is surprising, particularly in scenes where _Deadpool and Wolverine_ share poignant moments. One standout is Deadpool's farewell to Wolverine, which is both a nod to the characters' shared history and a poignant reminder of their enduring bond.

The film's action sequences are top-tier, with choreography that respects each character's unique fighting style. The inclusion of characters like Elektra, Blade, and even a hilarious cameo from Gambit adds layers of excitement and nostalgia. Wesley Snipes' return as Blade, complete with his signature line, ""Some motherfuckers always trying to ice-skate uphill,"" received one of the loudest reactions from the audience.

The story navigates the complexities of timelines and multiverse mechanics with a wink and a nod, never bogging down in overly technical explanations. This approach keeps the focus on the characters and their journeys, making for a more engaging and enjoyable experience.

How to Train Your Dragon 2,Comedy,"Like I said a couple of year ago during 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2' review, it's a terrible title for a sequel. The host, Neil Patrick also said the same thing during the 2015 Oscars. But in the digital world, slight change in the title makes random in order. I mean on the computer and web world, it won't show in order. Even sometime it might get lost in a vast number of other titles if they dare to chance the first word in the title for a sequel. Other than that they are not stupid as many people think. That's why they highlighted 'Dragon' boldly than the rest of the words.

This part two was not much different to its first. The story continues five years after Hiccup recovers from his injury. He and his pet, Toothless discovers a new land during the survey for the map. So their's adventure begins, but end in a trouble and forces all his people from the town to involve and fight against the rising evil force that tries to conquer them all.

Like I always say, those days are gone, now animated movies are for all ages. This was a very nicely and carefully written screenplay, did not fail to deliver. Very close to the impact the first movie made, but due to simplicity it stayed a couple of steps behind. Developed well with a bit of suspense, thrill and entertainment. Nothing more we could have asked, a perfect follow-up and hoping to explore beyond lot more in the upcoming movies in this series. Four years gap between the movies is a nice idea and fine breathing space for this franchise fan. A movie must be seen by animation fans, especially if you have already seen the first then don't miss it.

How to Train Your Dragon 2,Comedy,"The first one was good and the second is not any worse.

This series is standing out of the pack for its complex plot involving several topics, not just the typical ones in an animated movie. Arguably, they have been also treated in former movies; two main characters which are crippled (Finding Nemo ...), greater involvement of strong female roles (although, still, not as main characters and utterly in need of help from the male roles), ecology, etc.

The points I dislike the most is the speech of homeland being the good ""peacekeeper"" nation forced to use violence to keep it (peace). Quite hypocritical but, clearly, addressed to the US audience.

The repetitive line of story about the (nerd) hero who is the only one to save the world is quite tiresome too.

Finally, how lightly some other traumatic causing topics are treated: finding that a parent abandoned their child, death, etc ...

While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.

One of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.

The film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. 

While my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it’s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.

If there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it’s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",many movies within despicable franchise lost count storylines never big fan movies least always felt exciting however fourth installment gru storyline little dud silliness excitement younger audiences film lacks heart one main problems despicable movies tendency pile characters add celebrity voices cast fourth movie exception addition new characters sometimes breathe fresh life franchise feels like missed opportunity develop heartfelt story instance introduction new younger female character named poppy heist partner gru could chance add depth however might impactful see gru partnering oldest daughter teenager would added layer connection growth gru daughter showcasing evolving role father film also introduces subplot minions turned superhero team used movie less minutes subplot feels like wasted narrative thread could added excitement depth story additionally one main minions ralph stuck vending machine entirety movie reducing role mere gag sidelining key characters favor introducing new ones dilutes emotional core could made story engaging son enjoyed movie makes sense age range important films also entertain parents watching children earlier movies franchise managed strike balance humor kids clever moments adults installment however feels like series gags strung together rather cohesive story emotional weight films despicable series believe time hang however franchise continues wait streaming watch interested seeing theaters magic made original films entertaining broad audience seems faded without significant shift storytelling future installments likely feel lackluster,Negative
Despicable Me 4,Comedy,"If it's not sacrilegious to say, I think this franchise is starting to run out of steam - the plot here isn't very original. The family ""Gru"" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis ""Maxime Le Mal"" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, ""Silas"" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty ""Poppy"" knows the secret and blackmails ""Gru"" into helping her pinch ""Lenny"" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive ""Principal Übelschlecht"" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with ""Maxime"" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced ""Super Minions"" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore. It does liven up for the last ten minutes, but the previously innovative and enjoyable mix of menace and mayhem has largely gone.",sacrilegious say think franchise starting run steam plot original family gru new child much take father makes matters worse arch nemesis maxime le mal intent turning everyone cockroaches escapes custody bent revenge man put jail first place better safe sorry silas relocates family safe house pretend fit vacuous tennis club set one number feisty poppy knows secret blackmails gru helping pinch lenny badger eyes diminutive principal belschlecht alma mater adventure narks headmistress sees video perpetrators straight phone maxime hatches plan steal baby give wings minions newly formed enhanced super minions still manage fun discover new home vending machine endless supply popcorn wit dialogue story pretty derivative animation looks little tired ground breaking looks much less writing characterisations nothing special anymore liven last ten minutes previously innovative enjoyable mix menace mayhem largely gone,Negative
Despicable Me 4,Comedy,"The goofy Minions are on the loose again in “Despicable Me 4,” a lazy sequel that does little more to advance the franchise other than embodying the old adage of “style over substance” to a fault. There is very little here to recommend other than the first class technical achievements (the visuals are stunning, and the direction is better than expected for an animated film), making this installment feel more like a mindless baby sitter rather than a thoughtful exercise in creativity and storytelling.

Former supervillian Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is living the good life with his wife Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig), his daughters Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voice of Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voice of Madison Skyy Polan), and new baby Gru Jr., who proves to be a handful for his daddy. Their peaceful routine is sent into chaos when the evil Maxime Le Mal (voice of Will Ferrell) and his girlfriend Valentina (voice of Sofía Vergara) escape from prison and set their sights on a new nemesis and potential target: Gru. This forces the family to go on the run and assume new identities in the suburbs.

The plot is basic and sounds like it could be a lot of fun with its fish out of water spin. Unfortunately, very little is done with the story. The film bounces back and forth with a lame narrative and cute Minions taking part in a variety of wacky, screwball antics, which may provide a good balance for adults and kids, but nothing about any of it works well. The far too simple and sparse story meanders between uninspired plot points and predictable characters arcs, never quite finding its footing. In other words, the movie is just plain dumb.

The introduction of the Mega Minions is mildly fun and entertaining, but it runs out of steam fast (I fear these characters are going to spin off into what will inevitably be another lackluster film). Everything else is a shallow gimmick as the movie struggles to maintain momentum. At least it’s true to the “Despicable Me” canon, but the film also shows that there’s only so much you can do with these characters and this universe. Move along: there’s nothing original to see here.

“Despicable Me 4” is a lazy movie overall, which is a shame because the technical aspects are so excellent.

Despicable Me 4,Comedy,"Felt like it wasn't sure what its own film was trying to accomplish at all. 
One minute we're watching gru back in the AVL capturing another infamous villain thats known gru since high school. Only for him to escape and supposedly hunting gru back down in revenge.. which takes only the whole movie to find him.

No joke, its like waiting for Bart or Vector to go after gru but never finding any result till the last 10 minutes. Its a VERY BORING movie. Yes its for children but the first two films I felt like both adults and kids could enjoy it. 

Even the minions were meh in this, I usually have some chuckles if not with gru and his kids/family. They felt phoned in as well. Maybe its about time we stop making these yeah?

On a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age? This only works in television cartoon shows I feel like, especially when time has progressed since gru and lucy have been married. Either have the girls grow up too or don't have a baby in the film as if time skipped.",felt like sure film trying accomplish one minute watching gru back avl capturing another infamous villain thats known gru since high school escape supposedly hunting gru back revenge takes whole movie find joke like waiting bart vector go gru never finding result till last minutes boring movie yes children first two films felt like adults kids could enjoy even minions meh usually chuckles gru kids family felt phoned well maybe time stop making yeah side note gru kid clearly understand english tells hes least yet adopted children still exact age works television cartoon shows feel like especially time progressed since gru lucy married either girls grow baby film time skipped,Negative

The Roundup: Punishment,Comedy,"I really enjoy The Roundup franchise, its fast , paced, simple fun. That said, I'm not quite so enthusiastic about the latest film Punishment.

What makes these films work is simple fast paced, frenetic action combined with top class choreography. This film certainly has most of these elements but it doesn't work as well. Why? 

Perhaps its biggest short coming is its not especially cohesive. It builds and diffuses its much needed pace.This is not helped at all by  jumping between geographical locations and complicating the team dynamic. 

The main character behaving like a medieval vassal, getting on his knees at one point to beg to keep a case, didn't impress either. Nor does, the at times, rather lame humour,that feels tacked on.

On the upside what remains is moderately entertaining but its not enough to really see this iteration shine.

In summary, not every film in any franchise can be a winner. The Roundup: Punishment is not awful but its not all that good either.",really enjoy roundup franchise fast paced simple fun said quite enthusiastic latest film punishment makes films work simple fast paced frenetic action combined top class choreography film certainly elements work well perhaps biggest short coming especially cohesive builds diffuses much needed pace helped jumping geographical locations complicating team dynamic main character behaving like medieval vassal getting knees one point beg keep case impress either times rather lame humour feels tacked upside remains moderately entertaining enough really see iteration shine summary every film franchise winner roundup punishment awful good either,Negative
The Marching Band,Comedy,"“Thibaut” (Benjamin Lavernhe) is an accomplished conductor who is now based in the USA but who comes home to France now and again to perform. It’s during one such visit that he confides to his sister “Rose” (Mathilde Courcol-Rozés) that he needs a bone-marrow transplant. She readily agrees to help out but when she is found to be incompatible, that news opens quite a can of worms that results in him having to ask “Jimmy” (Pierre Lottin) - a brother he didn’t know he had and who lives in a quietly dying town where his workplace is earmarked for closure, to help out. Initially uninterested and disbelieving, the film now illustrates just how the two men come to terms with their past, their present and (hopefully) their future against a backdrop of resentment and privilege as they try to reconcile with the elements of “luck of the draw” that have governed their lives thus far. Fortunately, they have one thing in common. They both love music, and as it transpires that “Jimmy” plays trombone in his local mineworkers band we have a conduit for them to bond - or not! There are shades of “Brassed Off” (1996) as this offers us a social commentary on the decline of traditional rural industries that leave little by way of hope or opportunity in it’s wake; a little bit of romance and some seriously horrible uniforms too! Along the way, there is also some fine classical Mozart, some crooning from Charles Aznavour and some enjoyable band rehearsals with an eclectic collection of the townsfolk proving remarkably talented with instrument and voice alike - after a soupçon of guidance. No, there probably isn’t so much jeopardy about the denouement, though there is a twist - it’s really a story about family and one that’s presented without too much sentiment and a bit of enjoyably bloody-minded Gallic humour. I was never quite sure what an orchestral conductor actually did, standing there flailing his baton at a collection of perfectly proficient musicians, but this might just have helped explain a little - and that seating matters too!",thibaut benjamin lavernhe accomplished conductor based usa comes home france perform one visit confides sister rose mathilde courcol roz needs bone marrow transplant readily agrees help found incompatible news opens quite worms results ask jimmy pierre lottin brother know lives quietly dying town workplace earmarked closure help initially uninterested disbelieving film illustrates two men come terms past present hopefully future backdrop resentment privilege try reconcile elements luck draw governed lives thus far fortunately one thing common love music transpires jimmy plays trombone local mineworkers band conduit bond shades brassed offers us social commentary decline traditional rural industries leave little way hope opportunity wake little bit romance seriously horrible uniforms along way also fine classical mozart crooning charles aznavour enjoyable band rehearsals eclectic collection townsfolk proving remarkably talented instrument voice alike soup guidance probably much jeopardy denouement though twist really story family one presented without much sentiment bit enjoyably bloody minded gallic humour never quite sure orchestral conductor actually standing flailing baton collection perfectly proficient musicians might helped explain little seating matters,Negative

Elio,Comedy,"The geeky young “Elio” has been orphaned into the care of his military aunt “Olga” who works for Uncle Sam helping folks to navigate the debris that’s floating around in outer space. He likes to speak his own language “Elioese” and is fascinated, obsessed even, with making contact with alien life. He’s convinced that there is intelligent life out there, so imagine his surprise when he hears of a possible response from the Voyager mission sent decades ago. Next thing, well he is transported to the kaleidoscopic “communiverse” where everyone share peace, knowledge and friendship. Well, nearly everyone. The nasty “Grigon” wants to join but when they politely decline he threatens them with obliteration - and a verifiable obliteration at that. Clever these folks may be, but fighters they are not so it falls to “Elio” to prove his worth by trying to negotiate some sort of truce! Off to the big warship he goes, and that’s where he meets “Glordon” and learns a great deal more about his potential foe, and about friendship and loyalty as they embark on some lively escapades. Now there’s not a great deal here that could ever be called original. It’s got plenty of themes and tech rehashed from films gone by, but it’s still an enjoyable and fun tale with a message that resonates engagingly. It challenges stereotypes on just about everything from machismo bullying to parenting and cuddling and though the visuals are up to their usual high standard, fluid, imaginative and colourful, they don’t overwhelm the simplicity of the thrust which is a story about trust friendship. Will you recall it this time next year? Well no - probably not, but it keeps clear enough of too much sentiment, has some tea-time menace, mischief, laser cannons and it also reminded me of when I had a radio ham call sign too.",geeky young elio orphaned care military aunt olga works uncle sam helping folks navigate debris floating around outer space likes speak language elioese fascinated obsessed even making contact alien life convinced intelligent life imagine surprise hears possible response voyager mission sent decades ago next thing well transported kaleidoscopic communiverse everyone share peace knowledge friendship well nearly everyone nasty grigon wants join politely decline threatens obliteration verifiable obliteration clever folks may fighters falls elio prove worth trying negotiate sort truce big warship goes meets glordon learns great deal potential foe friendship loyalty embark lively escapades great deal could ever called original got plenty themes tech rehashed films gone still enjoyable fun tale message resonates engagingly challenges stereotypes everything machismo bullying parenting cuddling though visuals usual high standard fluid imaginative colourful overwhelm simplicity thrust story trust friendship recall time next year well probably keeps clear enough much sentiment tea time menace mischief laser cannons also reminded radio ham call sign,Negative
Elio,Comedy,"Elio is a heartwarming, intergalactic adventure that once again proves Pixar's mastery in crafting family-friendly stories layered with deeper emotional undercurrents. The voice cast is impeccable, with every performance radiating charm and sincerity, making it easy for viewers of all ages to connect with these vibrant characters. The score, as is typical for the studio, plays a pivotal role in guiding the emotional journey, gently elevating moments of wonder, sadness, and joy without ever feeling overbearing. There's an infectious sense of fun throughout, with plenty of space-faring antics to keep kids engaged, while older audiences will find value in the themes of loneliness, grief, and the universal desire for belonging.

However, Elio doesn't reach the emotional or narrative heights of Pixar's most iconic offerings. Its message, while undoubtedly impactful and accessible, feels too broadly framed to leave a lasting personal mark. The themes are universally relatable, but the movie's refusal to dig deeper into its more profound ideas keeps it from resonating on a soul-piercing level. It's touching, yes, but in a way that feels like a gentle nod rather than a heartfelt embrace. Still, Elio remains a commendable addition to Pixar's filmography - emotionally rich, charmingly performed, and filled with enough heartfelt moments to justify the trip across the stars.

Elio,Comedy,"Elio (Yonas Kibreab) is an 11-year-old boy who has recently lost his parents. He’s been taken in by his aunt Olga (Zoe Saldana). Olga works in orbital analysis and is gone a lot. Feeling like he doesn’t belong anywhere and nobody wants him, Elio finds comfort in interplanetary life. He takes on an obsession with ham radios and attempts to communicate with aliens while simultaneously trying to get abducted nightly.

One night, Elio is finally abducted by aliens. He’s introduced to an incredible new environment with alien species the likes of which the human eye has never seen or interacted with. He wants to stay forever until they reveal that they think he’s the leader of Earth. Elio lies his way into the alien community, but to stay he must risk his life to save them.

There are themes in Elio that are circled back around in elegant fashion. Elio loses his family before the film even begins. He’s also weird enough that he doesn’t have any friends. The film tries to paint Elio in a creative light like he has this big imagination because he’s invented his own language and can lie himself into and out of any situation. But he mostly comes off as a shitty person that treats his hard-working aunt, who only wants to support him and for him to love her, like dirt.

The animated sci-fi adventure film is about Elio coming to terms with the loss of his parents. He feels alone, has low self-esteem, and has extreme acceptance issues. But the film explores what it’s like to find your own family made of new friends and that you’re never really as low or alone as you think you are.

He is initially shipped off to boarding school because of his uncontrollable behavior and inability to not be a destructive shit. Once he’s at the Communiverse, he meets a liquid-like supercomputer named OOOOO. She clones Elio and sends his clone back to Earth so no one will notice that he’s gone. But as Elio checks up on him, he sees what it’s like to be a family with his aunt and becomes homesick.

Visually, the film is at its best when Elio is at the Communiverse. The Communiverse is filled with all sorts of alien leaders from all over the galaxy with the intent of sharing their knowledge with others and hopefully recruiting other respectable leaders. These sequences are filled with all sorts of eccentric creatures while its “alien” explanation allows things like basic physics or logic to be thrown out the window.

Hands down the best character and most enjoyable part of the film is Glordon. He is worm-like and his design was inspired by larval insects and microbiotic creatures like the tardigrade. His mouth seems to go on forever and is overrun with teeth kind of like a Dune sandworm. He can spin web like a spider and is heat and lava-resistant. He looks menacing and scary, but once he gets an English translator has an adorable little kid’s voice and is super expressive even though he doesn’t have any eyes. The friendship he develops with Elio has way more of an impact than the one the film forces him into with his aunt.

Unfortunately, Elio crawls at a slug-like pace through what feels like the longest hour and a half of the summer. It struggles through its first hour as Elio lies to everyone around him, gets in way over his head with the aliens, and attempts to abandon his aunt forever. Elio’s big plan is to join the alien community and leave Earth with no intention of ever going back. But apart from the enjoyable montage of Elio showing Glordon the Communiverse, the entire movie is just “Oh no, I lied too hard and don’t know what to do now.”

Animated films and TV shows have used slow-motion before, but Elio has some of the worst slow-motion effects in the history of animation. The slow-mo here looks like it was a decision that was made in post-production as the effect doesn’t look to be part of the animation but the editing of the film itself. It’s done in a way that makes you think the projector is acting up or something. It’s so jittery and awkward looking and the intended effect is probably not whatever you see on screen.

Elio is visually fun to look at and it gets somewhat entertaining in its last 20 minutes or so, but is otherwise a big, disappointing bowl of intergalactic garbage. The film chooses to follow an unlikeable character who is a brat the entire time and the main takeaway is that he shouldn’t be so much of a shithead and be decent to those who actually care about him for some reason.

Kung Fu Panda 4,Comedy,"This is probably my favourite of the franchised animated action-comedies, but I think we are now clearly running out of conceptual steam. With ""Po"" being told by ""Master Shifu"" that it is now time for him to move onwards and upwards - much to his chagrin - he must recruit a new dragon warrior so he can retreat to more cerebral pastimes. Luckily, though, the ""Chameleon"" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. ""Po"" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend ""Zhen"" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the ""Furious Five"". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it.",probably favourite franchised animated action comedies think clearly running conceptual steam po told master shifu time move onwards upwards much chagrin must recruit new dragon warrior retreat cerebral pastimes luckily though chameleon designs obtaining powers consigned nether realm using powers kung fu take world po put promotion hold along new found useful foxy friend zhen try thwart heinous ambitions though plenty action self deprecating dialogue storyline really much recycled affair even panda drawn multi verse frank bit bored theme especially never really accompanied much way jeopardy yes entirely predicable story case misses characterisations pals furious five watchable story well paced fun wobbly mountain top tavern think already forgotten,Negative
Kung Fu Panda 4,Comedy,"**Written by kindergartners using AI**

Even after more than 10 years, I still miss the first Kung Fu Panda movie as it was genuinely a masterpiece. The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.

This movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. 

Pathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.

Kung Fu Panda 4,Comedy,"<em>'Kung Fu Panda 4'</em> is much like its predecessors for me, I'm cool with them but they don't hit any deeper than being just solid movies. I had to watch a recap of the previous entries, naturally, and didn't remember much, aside from the cast and main characters.

I reckon I'll be saying the exact same thing in X amount of months about this one, that doesn't necessarily mean a film is bad though - because this release isn't. The voices we hear are perfectly satisfactory, from Jack Black to Awkwafina, Viola Davis (the best, away from lead) and the rest.

The music here is good. There is one piece of the score, which is heard a couple of times and during the end credits, that must be a homage of sorts to television show <em>'Dexter'</em> - weird connection granted, but it sounds practically exactly the same to me.

On the note of the sound, I enjoyed Tenacious D's rock cover of ""...Baby One More Time"". I listened to it an embarrassing amount when it first released alongside this movie, the video was admittedly part of the reason why - I'm always a fan of seeing film casts in music videos.

Detective Chinatown 1900,Comedy,"At times this is actually quite a fun spoof along the lines of ""Sherlock Holmes"" meets ""Charlie Chan"" by way of ""High Noon"" but for the most part it's a mess of a film that goes on for far too long. With the Manchu court facing the great powers we saw in ""55 Days at Peking"" (1963) the Empress Dowager dispatches her finest officer to San Francisco to track down a traitor. As it happens, the Holmesian ""Fu"" (Haoran Liu) is also in that very city on a quest for the killer of the daughter of senator ""Grant"" (John Cusack). Quite swiftly his investigation and the imperial mission start to overlap as the enthusiastic ""Fu"" and his newfound spiritual Indian guide ""Gui"" (Baoqiang Wang) discover that the prime suspect in the killing (Steven Zhang) is the son of local entrepreneur ""Bai"" (Chow Yun-Fat) and that the senator is using this to stir anti-Chinese sentiment to the point where he can force them out and seize their property. What now ensues delivers a series of rather randomly assembled escapades that mix murder mystery with western with romance and add a good dose of skullduggery to boot as they try to prove the young ""Bai"" was framed. Fu and Wang make for a decent enough double act at times, but the story loses it's way way too often and after a while the characterisations - especially ""Bai"" and ""Grant"" become light-weight and strained parodies. Fortunately, after about two hours, auteur Sicheng Chen must have felt he was running out of file space and so decided he'd better wrap things up - and for that last quarter of an hour the story knits together things we knew with things we didn't and presents us with a rather feeble denouement that did sort of suggest that there could be more adventures to come for the likeable ""Gui"" and ""Fu"". What is potent is the closing statement from the elder ""Bai"" about remembering the importance of immigrant labour in establishing a country that was all too quick to shun that working community later when it suited it, but it's made in a cack-handed and over-the-top fashion and drowned out by an overpowering score and thus loses much of an impact that might actually resonate in an USA that's still unsure how to recognise those who do/did the work but perhaps didn't all have the same/right skin colour or paperwork.

Anora,Comedy,"We’re all familiar with the old adage that, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. It’s a notion that applies not only to what can happen in everyday life, but also to what shows up on the big screen, as the latest feature from writer-director Sean Baker illustrates. This widely acclaimed indie offering follows the misadventures of a Brooklyn lap dancer/sex worker (Mikey Madison) who falls for the insanely rich, self-absorbed, wildly irresponsible son of a Russian oligarch (Mark Eydelshteyn). Together they take the plunge into an edgy, wacked-out fairy tale, a dark storybook romance strung out on steroids, quaaludes and crack. Their whirlwind affair soon lands them in Las Vegas, culminating in a green card wedding that junior’s mobster parents (Darya Ekamasova, Aleksey Serebryakov) want annulled at any cost, even if it means calling on their oily, bumbling posse of cronies and heavies (Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan, Yura Borisov) to lean on the alleged lovebirds. But achieving that goal ultimately proves more difficult than imagined. As a cross-country chase ensues, a string of frenzied events leaves mom, dad and friends infuriated and the Gothamite Cinderella disillusioned, having erroneously thought she’d truly hit the jackpot this time. From this, one might easily think this premise has a solid foundation for an outrageous, uproarious comedy, but, sadly, the film lives up to its potential only some of the time. To be sure, there is some genuinely hysterical, wonderfully inventive material here, but it only hits the mark about half the time. What’s more, much of the story (especially in the film’s first half) is predictable, almost clichéd, with some bits dragging on needlessly long. Indeed, I’m somewhat mystified as to what all the critical fuss is about, something perhaps best evidenced by the picture’s capture of the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the event’s highest honor. I readily admit to being a fan of Baker’s work, having immensely enjoyed his previous efforts “Red Rocket” (2021), “The Florida Project” (2017) and “Tangerine” (2015). But I’m genuinely at a loss to understand the level of praise that’s been lavished on this release. It’s a capable film in a number of respects, but the filmmaker clearly has done better, and those prior offerings make better viewing options in my opinion. Don’t fall for all the hype here, as this really is one of those cases of something being too good to be true.",familiar old adage something seems good true probably notion applies happen everyday life also shows big screen latest feature writer director sean baker illustrates widely acclaimed indie offering follows misadventures brooklyn lap dancer sex worker mikey madison falls insanely rich self absorbed wildly irresponsible son russian oligarch mark eydelshteyn together take plunge edgy wacked fairy tale dark storybook romance strung steroids quaaludes crack whirlwind affair soon lands las vegas culminating green card wedding junior mobster parents darya ekamasova aleksey serebryakov want annulled cost even means calling oily bumbling posse cronies heavies karren karagulian vache tovmasyan yura borisov lean alleged lovebirds achieving goal ultimately proves difficult imagined cross country chase ensues string frenzied events leaves mom dad friends infuriated gothamite cinderella disillusioned erroneously thought truly hit jackpot time one might easily think premise solid foundation outrageous uproarious comedy sadly film lives potential time sure genuinely hysterical wonderfully inventive material hits mark half time much story especially film first half predictable almost clich bits dragging needlessly long indeed somewhat mystified critical fuss something perhaps best evidenced picture capture palme year cannes film festival event highest honor readily admit fan baker work immensely enjoyed previous efforts red rocket florida project tangerine genuinely loss understand level praise lavished release capable film number respects filmmaker clearly done better prior offerings make better viewing options opinion fall hype really one cases something good true,Negative
Anora,Comedy,"""Ani"" (Mikey Madison) works as a private dancer in New York when she is asked by her boss to go look after some visiting Russians. That's when she encounters the young ""Vanya"" (Mark Eydelshteyn). He's pretty drunk, completely stoned and has more money than God. He wants a dance, he wants much more - but that's not allowed in the club, so he invites her to his luxury pad next day for fun. She actually quite likes his youthful exuberance - and his cash - and after a few days, a Russian sable coat, and a trip to Vegas, they find themselves marred. Social media now takes an hand and his oligarch mother hears news that her son has married an hooker. Livid, she instructs her local fixer ""Toros"" (Karren Karagulian) to sort the mess out. He duly sends his two enforcers to the house where all hell promptly breaks loose. ""Garnick"" (Vache Tovmasyan) and ""Tom"" (Anton Bitter) are merely to detain the pair until their boss arrives to insist that marriage is going to be annulled; ""Ani"" is having none of that and ""Vanya"" - well he's just a little bit conflicted and quickly things start to go pear-shaped! This film starts off strongly with an entertaining courtship scenario played out between two actors who really do look like they are enjoying themselves. Eydelshteyn delivers enthusiastically and acrobatically, there's loads of sex and quite witty dialogue that plays nicely on the language barriers. Once the second phase of the film starts, though, it runs out of steam a little. ""Vanya"" doesn't feature so much and the story becomes a little less engaging as the rather too gentle thugs and the increasingly irate girl try to get everyone to the courthouse for the ruling before his angry mother arrives. That leaves us with too much overacting from Karagulian and some increasingly implausible scenarios as the air is gradually let out of the thing and it comes to end rather disappointingly. At it's best, though, the first hour is quickly paced and takes an amiable swipe at the sex trade and the players who make and take from it.

Anora,Comedy,"Anora is a film that starts off strong, pulling you in with an intriguing setup and a well-paced first act. It follows a story that keeps you invested, blending drama with some unexpected humor. The second act stretches a bit longer than needed, but it's clear that was intentional to build atmosphere and let certain themes play out. While the pacing is deliberate, it sometimes feels like it's lingering in places that don't add much depth to the characters. That being said, the buildup is engaging, even if the payoff leaves something to be desired.

Sean Baker's directing is solid, capturing a raw, almost documentary-like feel that makes the film feel real and immersive. He knows how to make everyday settings feel alive and uses long takes effectively. The cinematography complements this, keeping things grounded with natural lighting and handheld shots that add an almost voyeuristic feel to the story. It’s visually well-crafted, even if it doesn’t aim for anything particularly stylized. The way the camera lingers on certain moments adds weight to the film's themes, even when the script doesn’t fully explore them.

Mikey Madison delivers a standout performance, carrying much of the film. She brings a layered energy to the role, making her character feel both confident and vulnerable when needed. The supporting cast does their job well, but the script doesn't give them much depth to work with. That’s one of the film’s weaknesses, while it sets up an interesting premise and characters, it doesn’t fully flesh them out. You get a sense of their motivations, but not much beyond that. The dialogue is sharp in some moments but feels underdeveloped in others, leaving certain interactions feeling a bit hollow.

The score and sound design are subtle, used more for atmosphere than standout moments. The film relies heavily on natural sounds and ambient noise, which works well for its grounded approach. It enhances the realism but doesn't do much to elevate the emotions of the film. 

Overall, Anora is a well-directed and well-acted film that keeps you engaged, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing. If you’re looking for a character-driven story with a raw, unfiltered feel, it’s worth a watch, but don’t expect a big payoff in the end.",anora film starts strong pulling intriguing setup well paced first act follows story keeps invested blending drama unexpected humor second act stretches bit longer needed clear intentional build atmosphere let certain themes play pacing deliberate sometimes feels like lingering places add much depth characters said buildup engaging even payoff leaves something desired sean baker directing solid capturing raw almost documentary like feel makes film feel real immersive knows make everyday settings feel alive uses long takes effectively cinematography complements keeping things grounded natural lighting handheld shots add almost voyeuristic feel story visually well crafted even aim anything particularly stylized way camera lingers certain moments adds weight film themes even script fully explore mikey madison delivers standout performance carrying much film brings layered energy role making character feel confident vulnerable needed supporting cast job well script give much depth work one film weaknesses sets interesting premise characters fully flesh get sense motivations much beyond dialogue sharp moments feels underdeveloped others leaving certain interactions feeling bit hollow score sound design subtle used atmosphere standout moments film relies heavily natural sounds ambient noise works well grounded approach enhances realism much elevate emotions film overall anora well directed well acted film keeps engaged quite stick landing looking character driven story raw unfiltered feel worth watch expect big payoff end,Negative
Anora,Comedy,"<em>'Anora'</em> is an absolute cracker! The film is unadulterated chaos, I honestly needed the silentness of it ending so I could relax. As usual, I'm not one to judge it on its deep-rooted meaning or whatever, I'll leave that to others, all I can say is that it's a blast and I unequivocally loved it.

Mikey Madison's performance is sensational, quite the showing indeed! Apparently I've seen her in three other things (much less prominent roles, admittedly) before, evidently I don't remember her from those - but safe to say, I won't be forgetting Madison from this at any point. Superb!

Away from the star performer, Mark Eydelshteyn makes the most out of his role. The trio of Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan and Yura Borisov are great comedic support. I've seen Aleksei Serebryakov here and there down the years and he always plays the same roles, I like him though.

The 139 minutes go by in a flash, with the utterly chaotic nature it is no surprise. It isn't the most difficult movie to predict given that you are waiting for the crap to hit the fan, but how it gets to that point is a wild ride to witness - the concluding scene is stand out, too.

I still have three more of the nominees to watch, but this overtakes <em>'The Substance'</em> as the film that would hypothetically get my vote for Best Picture; not that I take much value from that (or any other) awards ceremony.

Anora,Comedy,"Despite a very rough start, “Anora” ultimately offers a unique and entertaining exploration of the humanity behind sex work and the complexities of love, pain, and trauma. I was so close to giving up on the film during its excruciating opening thirty minutes, which I found dull, grating, and gratuitous. The early part of the movie is laden with an unnecessary and gratuitous parade of explicit scenes and a focus on unlikable characters doing uninteresting things. Now I am thankful that I didn’t storm out of the theater, because the eventual payoff is more than worth the investment.

As I reflect on the film, I’ve come to the realization that the style and tone of the film’s opening half hour might be more intentional than I first thought. Writer and director Sean Baker, known for his ability to capture the lives of marginalized people with empathy and complexity in his previous works “The Florida Project” and “Tangerine,” appears to be making a deliberate statement. The first act, with its emphasis on the superficial, transactional view of sex work, feels almost intentionally alienating, highlighting how society often reduces sex workers to mere objects of desire that exist solely to be used, abused, and discarded. It’s designed to make viewers uncomfortable, mostly because it seems to be a critique of how these people are seen as less than human. Sex workers like Anora are often dismissed as disposable rather than as individuals with depth and feelings.

Once the film transitions into the second act, it gains momentum and its true heartbeat emerges. The focus shifts to Anora (Mikey Madison), a young sex worker from Brooklyn who impulsively marries a powerful Russian oligarch’s playboy son, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn). As news of the marriage reaches Russia, it threatens to derail her new life. Ivan’s parents are infuriated and head to New York to have the union annulled. The plot sounds like a simple and goofy romantic comedy, but it becomes more layered as the film progresses.

Baker excels in depicting characters on the fringes of society, and Anora is no exception. She’s flawed, complicated, and completely human in her desire to be happy, safe, and loved. As we get to know the character better, her strength, resilience, and vulnerability shines through. It’s a real testament to how much Baker understands his characters and the environments they inhabit. They are never caricatures but relatable, normal people caught up in difficult, often tragic circumstances. And this, I think, is where the film really succeeds.

It’s a serious story that takes an unexpected turn when a trio of bumbling criminal characters show up, adding some much-needed levity and energy to the film. The comedic angle is strange but also highly entertaining, which provides a nice contrast to the tension-filled dramatic elements. The humor balances the more serious undertones of the story and injects an unexpected freshness into the film, making it easier (and a lot more fun) to invest in Anora’s journey.

What’s really going to have audiences talking is the ending, and it’s the place where the film leaves its most notable mark. I can imagine the final frame will be analyzed and discussed and misunderstood, but it’s one of the most profound, heartbreaking, and touching conclusions I’ve seen this year.

WARNING: I am issuing a spoiler alert for the next paragraph. Please stop reading now if you’ve not yet seen the film.

When Igor (Yura Borisov) and Anora are together in the final act, this isn’t a typical “rescue” or “knight in shining armor” trope that you’d expect to find in a romantic film. Their sad and painful attempt at intimacy is a deeply meaningful and emotional recognition between two people who have been hurt by the world in similar ways. It’s a poignant reminder that love and healing often come from shared experiences of pain, and that empathy can transcend even the most complicated circumstances. It’s just so heartbreaking and sad, and I’m not sure there’s another film that’s so accurately or sensitively conveyed a person’s haunting emotional wounds with such authenticity.

It goes without saying that despite a miserable opening, “Anora” ultimately won me over. This is a flawed but compelling story about a woman reclaiming her agency, confronting the societal labels placed on her, and finding something profoundly human in a world that seeks to strip her of it.

Anora,Comedy,"Sean Baker's Oscar-winning ""Anora"" presents a peculiar paradox of contemporary cinema: a film celebrated for its supposed boundary-pushing that ultimately offers little beyond its taboo subject matter. At 139 minutes, Baker's tale of a sex worker who briefly marries into Russian wealth before facing brutal rejection stretches a thin premise far beyond its natural breaking point.

Mikey Madison delivers a performance of remarkable depth, finding nuanced humanity in a character that the screenplay itself seems uninterested in fully exploring. Her work transcends the material, suggesting emotional complexities the script merely gestures at. Madison deserves every accolade for creating a compelling person where the screenplay offers only a situation.

The film's moments of genuine comedy provide welcome relief but highlight the fundamental problem: ""Anora"" mistakes setting (sex work) for substance. When compared to Jean-Luc Godard's ""Vivre sa Vie,"" which used prostitution as a lens to examine profound questions of autonomy, capitalism, and gender, Baker's film feels superficial. Godard achieved more philosophical depth in 83 minutes than Baker manages in over two hours.

Contemporary cinema increasingly confuses progressive subject matter with progressive thinking. Merely depicting marginalized experiences without offering fresh insight or formal innovation becomes a hollow exercise. One cannot help but wonder whether ""Anora"" received accolades for what it attempted to say rather than what it actually achieved.

The central narrative - a woman from difficult circumstances discovering she can be loved for herself - is neither original nor developed with particular insight. What might have been a focused, powerful short film instead becomes a meandering feature that suggests profundity without delivering it.

Baker's technical competence is evident, but technical skill alone cannot disguise the absence of a compelling artistic vision.

""Mickey 17 presents an intriguing sci-fi concept and raises interesting questions, even if it doesn't always explore them with the desired depth. 

Bong Joon-ho continues to demonstrate his mastery in blending genres, but here, the satire and lack of subtlety in the narrative end up limiting the emotional and philosophical impact of a story centered on sociopolitical themes like identity, technology, and colonialism.

Nevertheless, with a star-studded cast led by an excellent Robert Pattinson and a captivating audiovisual style, the South Korean filmmaker reinforces his status as one of the most creative directors working today, delivering an experience that falls somewhere between fascinatingly hilarious and frustratingly superficial.""

Mickey 17,Comedy,"Some movies have a way of hitting things right on the head, either intentionally or by happy accident. And such is the case in both regards in the latest offering from Oscar-winning writer-director Bong Joon Ho, a hilariously insightful sociopolitical sci-fi satire that knocks it out of the park in more ways than one can count. In an age of casual throw-away culture, “Mickey 17” takes this idea to an entirely new level by following the dubious exploits of the title character (Robert Pattinson), who works as an “expendable,” a human charged with determining just how lethal various new technologies and environmental conditions are in an off-world colony of the future. The ironic, questionable term for this profession is derived from the fact that its practitioners are considered wholly disposable in every sense of the word but are fully capable of being regenerated in full thanks to a form of digital human printing, allowing subsequent iterations of these beings to be created as often as needed. However, life isn’t quite so “simple and straightforward” for the Mickey expendable when he gets caught up in a series of complicated developments involving an illegal double, the whims of the maniacal cultist colony leader (Mark Ruffalo) and his self-absorbed wife (Toni Collette), the scheming of an unreliable, self-serving childhood friend (Steven Yeun), a relentless loan shark (Ian Hanmore) from his days back on Earth, and an aspiring romantic interest (Anamaria Vartolomei) who tries to get between Mickey and his girlfriend (Naomi Ackie), a passionate but badass security officer. The narrative’s various story threads blend well together (even if a few of them are a little stretched out or aren’t developed as fully as they might have been), but they collectively tell a well-integrated tale that generally keeps viewers riveted throughout. This captivating yarn is superbly supported by the picture’s inventive visuals, expert editing. and stellar performances, most notably Ruffalo, Collette, Ackie and the first-ever portrayal by Pattinson that I’ve actually liked. What makes this offering especially and somewhat inadvertently effective, however, is the timing of its release, which was originally scheduled for a year ago but was delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, a truly fortuitous blessing in disguise. Given current conditions in today’s turbulent sociopolitical climate, particularly the unpredictable leadership of one particular politician, “Mickey 17” couldn’t have debuted at a more pertinently appropriate time. (While I’ll spare the specifics here, let me just say that MAGA fans and evangelical conservatives probably won’t find this picture much to their liking.) In addition, the film deftly addresses a number of pressing social and cultural themes, such as how the average, everyday working class individual is looked upon and treated these days, the expendability question coming front and center. Some might see these attributes as somewhat heavy-handed or preachy, but then such “excesses” are the essence of good satire, and the filmmaker holds nothing back here. I’m also amazed that all of this was foreseen so far in advance of the emergence of current conditions, decidedly prescient and poignantly relevant in its insights. Indeed, this is genuinely a cinematic fable for our times – a rather scathing one, to be sure, but a damning fable nevertheless. Moreover, if this release is any indication of what 2025’s crop of new pictures will be like, I warmly welcome it given the awful movie year that has just passed. And, where “Mickey 17” is concerned, let’s hope that this all comes to pass – both on the big screen and otherwise.",movies way hitting things right head either intentionally happy accident case regards latest offering oscar winning writer director bong joon ho hilariously insightful sociopolitical sci fi satire knocks park ways one count age casual throw away culture mickey takes idea entirely new level following dubious exploits title character robert pattinson works expendable human charged determining lethal various new technologies environmental conditions world colony future ironic questionable term profession derived fact practitioners considered wholly disposable every sense word fully capable regenerated full thanks form digital human printing allowing subsequent iterations beings created often needed however life quite simple straightforward mickey expendable gets caught series complicated developments involving illegal double whims maniacal cultist colony leader mark ruffalo self absorbed wife toni collette scheming unreliable self serving childhood friend steven yeun relentless loan shark ian hanmore days back earth aspiring romantic interest anamaria vartolomei tries get mickey girlfriend naomi ackie passionate badass security officer narrative various story threads blend well together even little stretched developed fully might collectively tell well integrated tale generally keeps viewers riveted throughout captivating yarn superbly supported picture inventive visuals expert editing stellar performances notably ruffalo collette ackie first ever portrayal pattinson actually liked makes offering especially somewhat inadvertently effective however timing release originally scheduled year ago delayed due sag aftra strike truly fortuitous blessing disguise given current conditions today turbulent sociopolitical climate particularly unpredictable leadership one particular politician mickey debuted pertinently appropriate time spare specifics let say maga fans evangelical conservatives probably find picture much liking addition film deftly addresses number pressing social cultural themes average everyday working class individual looked upon treated days expendability question coming front center might see attributes somewhat heavy handed preachy excesses essence good satire filmmaker holds nothing back also amazed foreseen far advance emergence current conditions decidedly prescient poignantly relevant insights indeed genuinely cinematic fable times rather scathing one sure damning fable nevertheless moreover release indication crop new pictures like warmly welcome given awful movie year passed mickey concerned let hope comes pass big screen otherwise,Positive
Mickey 17,Comedy,"“Mickey” (Robert Pattinson) is desperate to avoid a grisly fate at the hands of a loan shark, so decides his best bet is to get off-planet. Thing is, there are an whole load of like-minded folk so his only hope is to be an expendable. That means he gets used for all the dangerous and experimental tasks and if he gets killed or seriously maimed, they just lob him in the incinerator and reprint him - complete with all his old and quite a few new memories. Travelling through space, he meets “Nasha” (Naomie Ackie) and they have a good thing going, even if the imperious couple in charge - Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette - have forbidden the wasting of the 100 calories it takes to have sex! Things start to go a bit wrong, though, when he unexpectedly survives one chilly mission only to find upon his return they have already duplicated his successor. “Nasha” thinks the ménage-à-trois thing could work quite well but “Mickey” less so, and when rumours of their duplicate existence starts to abound, well things get distinctly dodgy. Meantime, the indigenous population of the planet they have landed on are getting a bit cross with the murderous attitudes of their human interlopers, and so perhaps it’s gonna be for “Mickey” x 2 and “Nasha” to sort things out before the pitch changes altogether. It’s quite good fun this, but I kept thinking of “Galaxy Quest” and couldn’t decide if Ruffalo was having a go at Donald Trump or Val Kilmer with his rather hammy performance. Also, despite being easy enough on the eye, Pattinson is a remarkably charm-free actor and here, even when there are some daft scenarios and the CGI works flat out to create a perfect series of images, he just underwhelmed the whole time and when the film is about more than one of him, that mattered. Collette and Steven Yeun are relatively under-used and it’s simply far too long to sustain the thinness of a plot that does raise some interesting issues around human cloning, exploration and that especially American cinematic trait of shooting extra-terrestrials first and then asking question later, but I was disappointed with this, sorry.",mickey robert pattinson desperate avoid grisly fate hands loan shark decides best bet get planet thing whole load like minded folk hope expendable means gets used dangerous experimental tasks gets killed seriously maimed lob incinerator reprint complete old quite new memories travelling space meets nasha naomie ackie good thing going even imperious couple charge mark ruffalo toni collette forbidden wasting calories takes sex things start go bit wrong though unexpectedly survives one chilly mission find upon return already duplicated successor nasha thinks nage trois thing could work quite well mickey less rumours duplicate existence starts abound well things get distinctly dodgy meantime indigenous population planet landed getting bit cross murderous attitudes human interlopers perhaps gon na mickey x nasha sort things pitch changes altogether quite good fun kept thinking galaxy quest decide ruffalo go donald trump val kilmer rather hammy performance also despite easy enough eye pattinson remarkably charm free actor even daft scenarios cgi works flat create perfect series images underwhelmed whole time film one mattered collette steven yeun relatively used simply far long sustain thinness plot raise interesting issues around human cloning exploration especially american cinematic trait shooting extra terrestrials first asking question later disappointed sorry,Positive
Mickey 17,Comedy,"<em>'Mickey 17'</em> is a blast! What a fun time at the cinema this was. It delivers a super engaging plot, an excellent cast and some tremendous special effects. I, like almost everyone, love Bong Joon Ho's <em>'Parasite'</em>, but personally I'd rank this one of his higher.

That's likely a personal thing, this is more entertaining and highly likely more rewatchable; that named 2019 flick is quality, but I can't say I've had any inkling to revisit it since I watched it in 2020. Again, just me; it'll obviously vary person-to-person. Two great films, all the same.

Robert Pattinson is brilliant as the titular character, he kills it <i>(ba dum tss)</i> all the way through. Naomi Ackie is as terrific though, she is smashing it in recent years; hard to separate her fantastic performances in <em>'I Wanna Dance with Somebody'</em>, <em>'Blink Twice'</em> and this.

Mark Ruffalo, Toni Collette and Steven Yeun are super in their respective roles too. Top notch casting! Anna Mouglalis voices the leader of the Creepers, who I thought looked outstanding.

Mickey 17,Comedy,"""Mickey 17"" for those of us, old enough to remember has a Jerry Lewis in space, vibe. 

Mickey's a sad sack, goofy, kind of misfit, who finds himself becoming essentially, a recyclable ""crash test dummy"", in space, to avoid an arguably worse fate, on earth, at the hands of sadistic, loan sharks. 

Simply put, this irritated me from beginning to end. Its not what it needs to be, that is,  genuinely witty and off the wall, likeable. What you get instead, is dark, oftentimes cruel, populated by shabby characters, that are selfish and annoying, in equal measure. If this a species of commentary and, or satire on the human condition, its not a very hopeful one, to say the least.

Acting is only passable, too. The main character's don't stand out and there is nothing to off set their marked limitations. At least, Lewis, who I never liked, had the jovial and engaging, Dean Martin. 

In summary, this is not only not special, its rather bleak, bland and ultimately tedious. It could have been more with upbeat handling and genuine Monty Python-esque humour but that's conspicuous, by its absence. A mediocre watch, at best.",mickey us old enough remember jerry lewis space vibe mickey sad sack goofy kind misfit finds becoming essentially recyclable crash test dummy space avoid arguably worse fate earth hands sadistic loan sharks simply put irritated beginning end needs genuinely witty wall likeable get instead dark oftentimes cruel populated shabby characters selfish annoying equal measure species commentary satire human condition hopeful one say least acting passable main character stand nothing set marked limitations least lewis never liked jovial engaging dean martin summary special rather bleak bland ultimately tedious could upbeat handling genuine monty python esque humour conspicuous absence mediocre watch best,Positive
Death of a Unicorn,Comedy,"<em>'Death of a Unicorn'</em> is potential-laden, though unfortunately I just never really got my teeth into this one. The whole set-up is severely underwhelming, the whole plot with the rich family just didn't do it for me. It does pick up at the conclusion, which is where I see the potential.

A movie solely about the Kintners and the unicorns could've been ace, especially if it lent into the fantasy side of it; almost if it was <i>(iffy association incoming)</i> <em>'How to Train Your Dragon'</em>-esque, just with all the gore and death that this 2025 releaes does hold. The final scene, as oddly over the top as it is, shows the promise.

Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega are decent in their respective roles, not that I have any core moments to take from either of them here though. The Leopolds, as much as I wish they weren't in the film, are portrayed well enough by those on the screen, Will Poulter is minorly amusing to be fair.

Death of a Unicorn,Comedy,"There is something disappointingly formulaic about this comedy drama that really never quite comes alive. It doesn’t start so promisingly as we meet “Elliot” (Paul Rudd) who is travelling with his estranged teenage daughter “Ridley” (Jenny Ortega) to the remote wilderness home of his would-be benefactors whom he is hoping will give him power of attorney over a large lump of cash. “Odell” (Richard E. Grant) is the patriarch, and on his last legs; “Belinda” (Téa Leoni) is his wife and “Shep” (Will Poulter) his sharp as a spoon son - and “Elliott” is out to impress. Thing is, he is very late for their appointment. Why? Well they hit something on the road to the house and, well it isn’t the kind of thing you meet on the road every day - even if you are Tom Cruise. They assume this critter is no more, so imagine their surprise when it starts to make it’s presence felt in their host’s car park! A bit of research reveals not just what this is, but also that it’s blood could have miraculous healing powers (think phoenix’s tears). Could this be the miracle cure old “Odell” is looking for? Well more likely it is the source of grief for all concerned when it’s mum and dad realise it’s not come home to their cave for supper and set off, quite angrily, to retrieve their offspring. The story tries to introduce a little elemental fantasy to the proceedings, but with the possible exception of Leoni who seems to be prepared to go with the joke, the others aren’t really at the races. Grant resorts to uber-ham mode, Poulter tries but has little to work with and neither Rudd nor Ortega do much with this “Bambi” does “Jurassic Park” enterprise. There’s a fun role for Anthony Carrigan as their “Lurch” style factotum “Griff” - the only one in the whole thing who might actually have a brain, but otherwise this is all a triumph for girth over substance.

Barbie,Comedy,"_Barbie_ reels you in with its silly humor and fantastical ideas. The war of Kens during the last half hour of the film is an all-timer because a battle full of handsome maneuvers, like showing off their naked chest and manly noogies, turns into a full on dance off between Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu.

But the second half of the film leaves a thought-provoking message in your brain regarding both men and women. The Kens gaining respect little by little mirrors how women eventually earned their rights to be respected individuals — after being considered as only being useful in the kitchen or for making babies — except with the gender roles reversed and nude blobs instead of genitalia.

Barbie,Comedy,"""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",thus spake zarabarbie opening message narrated dame helen mirren gives us potted history doll origins inanimate plaything young girls current status empowering conduit young girls emerge society uninhibited aspirational beings sky limit well philosophy margot robbie barbieland sterile sort environment lives life along lines pink groundhog day men well yes embodied tanned rippled toned ken ryan gosling much app purchase world little purpose aside augmenting barbie strangely one morning stereotypical barbie finds lost charm flat footed endlessly elysian existence fraying edges see weird barbie emerald fennell seek sagely advice however like must enter real world find whoever supposed playing clearly happy girl see cheer restore equilibrium en route finds ever devoted ken join arrival big city introduces bewildering world sexists misogynists cynics latter best exemplified sasha somewhat disenchanted owner boss mattel ferrell discovers escape mobilises whole organisation get back box whilst equally disillusioned newly engaged ken heads back home realising maybe men live quite understudy lives elude pursuers long enough befriend sasha much less cyclical mother gloria america ferrera get home world alien good fun gosling talented actor also churn decent power ballad oddest chemistries much form robbie puts heart soul loads joyous bemused facial expressions role greta gerwig noah baumbach written witty script pitches naive innocent venal observational swipes things sexist woman perspective either though ridicule restrictions society put historical progression women ranks corporate america positive enjoyable satirical manner ferrell take leave really adequate epitome male dominated company structure quite nice set scenes rhea perlman ever carla cheers portrays inventor word whole barbie concept knits nicely together towards end snob get cinema prepare entertained bergman enjoyable evaluation parody st century life opportunity things vacuous certainly,Negative
Barbie,Comedy,"This was an _excellent_ film that left me emotionally stretched in just the right way. It's an adult movie with childhood references (not a kids' film at all), and seems pitched at people roughly my age (Matchbox 20 referenced as a track for wooing is too close for comfort!) It _superbly_ voices the internal contradictions women need to navigate to be accepted. It works hard not to centre Ken, even while his role is a critical counterpoint, but also gives a little airtime to how much a male-dominated world makes it hard to be a man too.

The writing is out of this world, the pacing is spot on, and Margot Robbie utterly _nails_ the role — especially the emotional and physical aspects of being a doll in a way that playfully nods to the many ways that children play with Barbie.

It's a wonderful film that I'd encourage everyone to see. It's _hard_ to watch, as a man—feeling responsible for so many challenges women face—but Barbie doesn't judge, it voices. It's a message that informs me, helps me, as well as entertaining me, but it isn't meant for _me_; the extent to which Yvette felt seen, understood and perfectly spoken on behalf of _is_ this movie, and why it deserves all the praise it's getting.

Barbie,Comedy,"“Heavy is the arm that wears its heart on its sleeve.” That’s the best way to sum up this overwritten, overlong, stunningly obvious treatise on gender equality, consumerism and existentialism, whose messages get beaten to death beginning early on and never let up, an exhausting experience, to be sure. Writer-director Greta Gerwig’s latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that’s about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What’s more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like “writing” than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself). To its credit, “Barbie” does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman. Beyond that, though, this is handily the most overrated, overhyped release of the summer movie season, one that I’ll easily forget before year’s end – and one that conclusively proves the power of marketing, no matter what the quality of the merchandise being promoted.",heavy arm wears heart sleeve best way sum overwritten overlong stunningly obvious treatise gender equality consumerism existentialism whose messages get beaten death beginning early never let exhausting experience sure writer director greta gerwig latest offering co written collaborator noah baumbach features dreadful script subtle young adult novel drones minutes longer needs becomes endlessly repetitive incorporates story threads could easily scaled back eliminated entirely ferrell michael cera much dialogue either stupefyingly juvenile sounds like writing anything anyone would actually say even fictional fantasy character attempts humor often fall woefully flat honest intents purposes project comes across like two hour commercial mattel even company manages find ways poke fun credit barbie strengths going superb production design genuinely clever humor especially opening pre titles sequence occasional asides fine performances margot robbie ryan gosling manage make material look better actually well heartwarming appearance rhea perlman beyond though handily overrated overhyped release summer movie season one easily forget year end one conclusively proves power marketing matter quality merchandise promoted,Negative

Barbie,Comedy,"The _Barbie_ movie is funny, and fun, and moved with deft pace from laughs to moments so engaging you could hear a pin drop in the theatre.

Its social message should not be controversial — _Barbie_ is a _critique of power and status quo_. 

Its allegory in art swings at every in-power group, and gives voice to every marginalized group.

There's even a point at which Barbie longs to restore the status quo in Barbieland and return to her position of privilege, and is chastised by Ken who, having reversed the roles, asks her ""how does it feel?"" (to be not seen, to not matter).

_Barbie_ illustrated clearly that _the status quo hurts everyone, including those in power_ — in other words, challenging the status quo is good for men as well as woman (and insert every other power dynamic here  — able-bodied as well as mobility-challenged, rich as well as poor, etc.)

That its social message is controversial proves its necessity. The only way this critique on power and status quo could be misconstrued as an attack on men is if people think power and control of the status quo belong only to men — which, eureka! is precisely what this movie is speaking to.

Barbie,Comedy,"**Barbie's breathtaking visuals and practical effects outshine the erratic storytelling to make a fresh and innovative movie with themes that will be divisive for many.**

Barbie is a visually stunning achievement that has excelled at the box office while dividing audiences. On the one hand, Barbie amazes with extravagant practical sets and exceptional performances, but on the other hand, the story and directing feel chaotic and erratic. The target audience seems to be moms who played with Barbies and would bring their daughters to the film. Therefore, some film's themes feel more grown up than expected for a movie about a child's toy. Despite probably not being the primary target demographic, I enjoyed the film, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performance. They elevated the story and script to the successful giant the movie has become. The casting of Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell was perfect for the roles they portrayed. The sets and production design were some of the most impressive I have ever seen in a film! The story was unfocused and unpredictable but also fun and lighthearted.

Barbie,Comedy,"First off, let me say that the production aspects of Greta Gerwig's Barbie are ... incredible. It is a beautiful movie and an incredible homage to its subject matter and its selected era aesthetic.

The movie itself is far more complex, with dozens of delightful, if not bravura, performances (Margot Robbie is, no matter what Helen Mirren says, perfection), coupled to an intricate narrative and examination of concepts around feminism, patriarchy, interpersonal relationships, societal norms, existentialism, capitalism, self-actualization, and a stubborn defiance of expectations to turn an message movie about dolls into a cartoon of easy heroes and villains.

I'm always a bit leery about saying something is brilliant, or even profound, but I will say that Barbie is simultaneously entertaining, nostalgic, hilarious, moving, inspirational, and thought-provoking, and I look forward to re-watching it a number of times in the future.

Barbie,Comedy,"<em>'Barbie'</em> has more to it than I would've predicted. It's a good movie.

I steer clear of as much film promo as possible, so was kinda expecting this to be more of a 'proper' comedy - just an assumption on my part. It does have humour but it's far from the film's main thing, there are a few chucklesome moments but I found it to be more earnest than funny.

It does get a tiny bit moralistic, though undoubtedly has the right intentions and does certainly hit the nail on the head with certain points. The story itself is interesting, I like that they didn't lean deep into the usual fish out of water stuff when Barbie visits the real world. I enjoy how the world is set, with the multiple Barbies and Kens etc.

The cast are great. Margot Robbie is top notch - the perfect choice. Ryan Gosling is excellent as well, while America Ferrera, Will Ferrell and Michael Cera are positives too. Away from those onscreen, the look of the film is splendid and the soundtrack fits well - even if Charli XCX's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxZwCpgxttQ"" rel=""nofollow"">track</a> is the only one I'd intentionally listen to.

Barbie,Comedy,"[Blu-ray HD Movies Store](https://www.bluray-discs.com)

My feelings were somewhat ambivalent before watching ""Barbie"". Due to my admiration for Greta Gerwig's films and her personal work, I had high expectations. However, the comprehensive marketing of ""Barbie"" had me concerned that it might fall into the trap of consumerist pseudo-feminism and face backlash from the public.


But I must say, this film truly exceeded my expectations!

Perhaps many people watched ""Barbie"" for the nostalgia of their childhood, but this movie is not about creating a pure and nostalgic atmosphere like ""Toy Story"". It is a profound and highly modern film with a thought-provoking core, marking a breakthrough for Hollywood in commercial films with feminist themes. Its narrative remains closely linked to various issues in modern society. While it includes the passionate declarations and satirical commentary on patriarchy often seen in feminist films, it also sincerely attempts to build bridges for dialogue between genders and among the same gender.


This is particularly evident in its depiction of ""patriarchy"" and the ""male gaze.""

**What is patriarchy?**


The answer presented by the film is that patriarchy does not necessarily refer to a society solely ruled by men. The essence of patriarchy lies in the imbalance of power structures, thus any society where one party dominates or suppresses the discourse of another is an embodiment of patriarchy. The film conveys this through the contrasting portrayal of Barbieland, which represents a matriarchal society, and Kendom, which represents a patriarchal society, as well as the power struggles between the two and their resulting consequences. In Barbieland, the Barbies have absolute dominance in social, political, economic, and cultural aspects. The night festivities always belong to the Barbies, while Kens merely serve as props. On the other hand, Ken, after experiencing the baptism of the real world (the true patriarchy society), immediately becomes more patriarchal and transforms Barbieland into Kendom, adopting the patriarchal system of the real world. The power dynamics are thus reversed, and the Barbies become mere servants to the Kens. However, whether it is Ken in Barbieland or Barbie in Kendom, both are unable to express themselves freely. They both inevitably become objectified beings, seeking their own worth through the validation of others. This is because the web of power restricts subjectivity and is independent of gender. Anyone, regardless of gender, can be the perpetrator of patriarchy, and anyone, regardless of gender, can be a victim of patriarchy. This exploration sets the film apart from many mainstream movies that fail to delve into the complexities of patriarchy.


That being said, the climactic scene where the Barbies reclaim political power seems to suggest that female governance is stronger than solely male governance, but with the need for certain modifications. However, upon watching it only once, I am not entirely certain about this point.

**Reproduction of the Four Gazes of Gender**


It can be said that the film industry has always been built upon the male gaze, while the female gaze has gradually become familiar with the progress of society and the increasing influence of women in consumer culture. However, the male gaze often found in films is directed towards sexualized female characters, especially evident in the visual language. Similarly, the female gaze is based on the objectification of male characters from the perspective of female viewers. In contrast, the discussion of male gaze towards other males or female gaze towards other females, and the impacts they generate, are rarely brought up in public discourse.


These four dimensions of gender gaze are represented to varying degrees in the film ""Barbie"". In Barbieland, the Kens are the objects of gaze and are in a passive position both physically and mentally. After experiencing the privileges brought by patriarchy for males in the real world, Ken projects his inner desires and fantasies onto successful male figures in reality, ultimately achieving self-identification with these masculine qualities by establishing Kendom. The Barbies in Kendom, including Barbie herself portrayed by Robbie, and the peculiar gaze directed towards them when they enter the real world, represent the reproduction of the male gaze. The Barbies in Barbieland may appear carefree and glamorous, but they still hold certain underlying consensus regarding ""beauty"". That is why Barbie becomes so alarmed when she discovers that her feet are no longer in the shape of high heels but can fully touch the ground, or when her skin develops cellulitis instead of remaining smooth. This also explains why the unconventional and eccentric Barbie advocating female liberation and freedom is initially excluded from the mainstream in Barbieland, only to be eventually accepted at the end.

**Non-stereotypical Feminism in Barbie**


The third highlight of this film lies in its unconventional expression of feminism, primarily manifested through the construction and subsequent shattering of Barbieland, which breaks away from the clichés of commercial films representing female themes, such as those centered around young girls.


Postfeminism emerged in the 1980s as a critique and reflection on the waves of the second-wave feminist movement. It is not a singular school of thought, but rather encompasses a broad concept containing various voices. According to feminist scholar Angela McRobbie, postfeminism overly emphasizes individual choices, which hinders the understanding of gender's structural role and impact, thereby weakening the force of social change. Furthermore, in the context of the ""sheconomy,"" postfeminism's endorsement of consumerism also poses the danger of reducing feminism to a commodity or marketing strategy. This, in turn, obstructs people from acknowledging the real challenges faced by women in economic, political, and social spheres. From this perspective, the film's portrayal of Barbieland and the lifestyles and states of the Barbies in the early stages carries a strong sense of postfeminism.


Surprisingly, the film ingeniously transitions to Barbie crossing over into the real world and embarking on a series of explorations regarding gender, emotions, life, and death. This breaks the singular fantasy that Barbie and female viewers may have about Barbieland, preventing the story from becoming a mindless action flick. The film not only advocates for body diversity and inclusivity in women but also delves deeply into Barbie's journey of personal growth, showcasing how she transforms from an innocent and simple assembly line doll into a fully realized human being with genuine emotions and a strong sense of self-will. In this regard, ""Barbie"" truly reconstructs the meaning of Barbie, imbuing its feminism with a more enriching and sincere undertone.

**Intriguing Plot and Character Designs**


Proactively deconstructing oneself
Two particularly memorable scenes stand out in this regard. First, Margot Robbie's Barbie, in a self-deprecating manner, criticizes her own appearance while others hurriedly try to console her. Suddenly, a voice-over interjects, implying that even the director chose Margot Robbie to play the role of Barbie, making the self-critique less convincing (laughs). The second scene involves the CEO of the Barbie manufacturer rejecting the film's mom character's passionate plea for aesthetic diversity in Barbie's production. However, as soon as his subordinate suggests that this approach could be highly profitable, he immediately changes his stance, simultaneously mocking capitalism and poking fun at himself.

Filming war scenes
This film is packed with entertaining plot twists and visuals, one of which includes a chaotic gathering of Ken soldiers amidst Kendom's disarray. Greta transforms the typical war scene, filled with sword fights and rivers of blood, into a lively and adorable virtual pet brawl, showcasing her unique and imaginative approach.

Allan's character design
The design of the character Allan is also quite intriguing. In a Barbieland where all males are named Ken and all females are named Barbie, where gender traits and boundaries are distinct, Allan stands out as a one-of-a-kind existence, defying any specific gender definition, be it in name, personality, or appearance. This adds a touch of queerness to the film.

Homage to various works
""Barbie"" pays homage to several classic films, showcasing their imaginative style. Examples include the opening sequence reminiscent of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" the choice between two pills reminiscent of ""The Matrix,"" and the dance choreography of the Ken characters during the civil war, which nods to ""Singing in the Rain"" (Greta has expressed her love for this film in multiple interviews, showing genuine appreciation!).

""I want to see a gynecologist""
Initially, the significance of this final line may be unclear, but thanks to explanations from online users, it becomes apparent. Barbie, originally a doll devoid of human reproductive organs, mentioning a gynecologist implies that she now has a vagina. The desire to visit a gynecologist can be seen as her way of exploring and understanding herself as a human being.

When it comes to flaws in this film, one could argue that the pacing of the narrative is too fast, at times feeling abrupt, such as in the resolution of the mother-daughter conflict. However, one could also argue that this is a deliberate choice driven by its commercial nature, and in a way, it aligns with the film's whimsical and imaginative style.


One scene in particular deeply touched me, and that is the ending where Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, and Barbie herself transcend the barriers of time and space to come face to face once again. The elderly Handler gazes tenderly at the doll she once single-handedly brought to life, encouraging her to bravely explore the possibilities of life and accompany her through the final stage of her awakening. In this seemingly frozen moment, the love they share flows gently in the soft whispers of Billie Eilish.


In the end, both Ken and Barbie find their own purpose and value, and through their individual journeys of growth, the film constructs a vision of an ideal world:


In this world,


everyone has the right and courage to be themselves.


In this world,


It’s not Barbie and Ken，


It’s not Ken and Barbie，


It’s Barbie and it’s Ken。",blu ray hd movies store https www bluray discs com feelings somewhat ambivalent watching barbie due admiration greta gerwig films personal work high expectations however

Barbie,Comedy,"#MovieReview #BarbieMovie #TheBarbieMovie #Barbie

In my opinion, this movie was well-executed, striking a balance between fantasy and reality. ""Barbie"" takes viewers on an exhilarating journey, bringing the beloved doll and cartoon character to life in a spectacular live-action adaptation.

Margot Robbie shines in her role as Barbie, delivering a fantastic performance alongside a talented cast. While there were a few questionable choices in terms of casting, such as introducing a transgender Barbie character, it did not detract from the overall appeal of the film. While it may have caused some confusion among viewers, the movie's charm remained intact.

America Ferrera delivers a powerful and empowering monologue in the film, showcasing her incredible talent and versatility as an actress. Her transition from ""Ugly Betty"" to this role is commendable, and she truly stands out in the movie.

""Barbie"" is a fun and quirky film that may not be suitable for very young children or those who prefer to shield their kids from certain themes in movies. It offers an over-the-top experience that may not be everyone's cup of tea.

Karate Kid: Legends,Drama,"The marketing around this has been terrible, I thought, so I was not really expecting much - but it’s not so very bad after all. That’s almost entirely down to a cheeky and engaging effort from Ben Wang as the young “Li Fong” who has recently (and reluctantly) arrived in Los Angeles from Beijing with his doctor mother (Ming-Na Wen) after a family tragedy which we go into a little more, later. He befriends pizza family “Victor” (Joshua Jackson) and his teenage daughter “Mia” (Sadie Stanley) but quickly - and quite brutally - discovers that former prize-fighting dad is in hock to a loan shark and so wants to try to punch his way out of his problems. When he realises that the young lad has some skill with kung-fu, they decide to team up and that’s the start of their escapades that ultimately pitches the new arrival against local champion “Conor” (Aramis Knight). For that challenge, he is lucky to have the help of his visiting Chinese mentor “Shifu” (Jackie Chan) who manages to elicit the assistance of the original “Karate Kid” himself (Ralph Macchio) so he may practise the more cerebral “Miyagi” form of karate. Predictable? Well, yes and Macchio is about as wooden as one of his late, lamented, master’s bonsai trees but there’s a little gentle mischief from Chan and just about enough action to stop the melodrama from swamping the thing. You will probably never recall it half an hour after you’ve seen it, but it’s is probably second to the original (1984) and passes a couple of hours effortlessly.",marketing around terrible thought really expecting much bad almost entirely cheeky engaging effort ben wang young li fong recently reluctantly arrived los angeles beijing doctor mother ming na wen family tragedy go little later befriends pizza family victor joshua jackson teenage daughter mia sadie stanley quickly quite brutally discovers former prize fighting dad hock loan shark wants try punch way problems realises young lad skill kung fu decide team start escapades ultimately pitches new arrival local champion conor aramis knight challenge lucky help visiting chinese mentor shifu jackie chan manages elicit assistance original karate kid ralph macchio may practise cerebral miyagi form karate predictable well yes macchio wooden one late lamented master bonsai trees little gentle mischief chan enough action stop melodrama swamping thing probably never recall half hour seen probably second original passes couple hours effortlessly,Positive

I didn’t like this. That said, my only frame of reference for The Karate Kid is that one How I Met Your Mother episode, so I haven’t seen the original films. But because I know how much people hype this franchise and how beloved it is, I went in expecting a lot. I expected phenomenal karate choreography, some intense emotional moments, and real substance.
Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I don’t think I’m the target audience for this film, honestly, it didn’t feel like it was made for me, which is absolutely fine. It lacked depth, it didn’t have the emotional or narrative weight I was hoping for, and the overall vibe just didn’t land with me. The Karate Kid: Legends wasn’t for me.

F1,Drama,"With Sir Lewis Hamilton and F1 media veteran Ian Holmes amongst those at the helm of this production, you can be certain that it’s going to be as an authentic story of all things F1 (can’t be bothered finding the trademark symbol) as you’re ever likely to see. It’s all about team “Ruben” (Javier Bardem) whose cars couldn’t beat an egg and so is looking at ending up broke! His remaining driver is British rookie “Joshua” (Damson Idris) but he’s nowhere near experienced enough to make any impact on the problem. For that, he needs to coax back “Sonny” (Brad Pitt) who did drive these cars twenty years ago but hung up his helmet after an accident and then became an itinerant driver eking a living across the USA. Can he be tempted? Well we’d have no film if he wasn’t so the next question is: can he manage to salvage this operation before it’s sold for scrap? True to form with this sport, what now ensues sees all the glitz and glamour of circuits around the world; money no object cars, training and equipment; testosterone galore both in the car and with team tech director “Kate” (Kerry Condon) as well as a whole slew of rule manipulating, crashes, downright cheating and I have to say, some of the best action and in-car photography I’ve seen on a big screen. Indeed, I could cheerfully have lived without the dramatic characterisation here altogether, and just stuck to the tensely directed and really compelling action sequences that, especially using the in-car cameras, is genuinely quite exciting to watch. You really do get a sense of the speed of the cars racing round the tracks and of the phenomenal engineering that goes into the design and manufacture of these cars that at times look no more substantial than an Airfix kit. Pitt is in his element here delivering a character that’s a lovable rogue meets smug git whilst Idris comes across entirely naturally as the youngster out of his depth but willing and determined to learn. The soundtrack from the likes of Queen and Led Zeppelin livens up what I’d have to say isn’t Hans Zimmer’s most memorable score, and with the last half hour largely devoid of the romantic and emotional clutter, we watch something that shows us this circus in full pomp.

Materialists,Drama,"Definitely not a Rom-Com. (And that's a good thing.)

-

Some false advertising with this one. 

There's romance, yes. There are a few laughs, yes. This, however, is not a romantic comedy.

What it is is a two-hour philosophical journey on the themes of self-worth, value, and materialism through the lens of three very flawed characters. 

As a cynic, I appreciated that. With such beautiful principal actors it would be very easy to gin up a 90's or 00's type of rom-com, but this was exceedingly more thoughtful and interesting.

Materialists,Drama,"Celine Song's Materialists is a stunningly mature, emotionally intelligent romantic drama, one that redefines the very concept of modern love without falling into the usual pitfalls of the genre. Anchored by three outstanding performances, Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal share extraordinary chemistry that feels raw, layered, and heartbreakingly authentic. Song's screenplay dissects with surgical precision the transactional nature of today's dating world, where intangible values like affection and vulnerability often struggle against the ever-growing checklist of material, social, and political boxes. Money, body image, height, political leanings - even something as seemingly trivial as the texture of one's hair - are thoughtfully explored as factors that, in theory, should dictate compatibility. But through intimate silences, aching glances, and conversations that pierce right through the soul, Song reminds us that love, in all its flawed, inexplicable glory, cannot be quantified.

Technically, Materialists is a masterclass in restraint. There's barely a musical score to be found, allowing every silence, every breath, and every hesitant word to carry the full weight of the characters' feelings. The cinematography makes the bold, unconventional choice to focus on the listener rather than the speaker, granting the audience rare insight into the unsaid, the reactions that words alone can't convey. Lingering shots in moments of silence exude not only tension but a rare, electric chemistry between the characters. The film crafts its emotional crescendo without a single moment of forced dramatization, making the eventual choices of Johnson's character feel entirely organic. Song bravely avoids providing easy answers: there's no judgment, no clear winner in the love triangle. Whether one follows love with all its imperfections, as in the Dakota-Evans connection, or chooses the materially perfect partner lacking in emotional spark, as represented by Pascal's character, Materialists argues that either path is valid - and equally human.

If there's one area where Song perhaps leans too heavily, it's in the recurring client interviews of Johnson's character, which, while often sharp and humorous, begin to border on repetitive. The thematic point about society's shallow dating expectations lands early on, and a couple of these scenes feel like they're spelling out what the rest of the movie has already conveyed so gracefully. But this minor excess does little to detract from the overall impact. Materialists stands as one of the finest romantic dramas in recent memory, brilliantly avoiding the traps of cliché and formula. It's a profoundly insightful exploration of why we fall in love, and how that choice - no matter how irrational, imperfect, or impractical - might be the truest thing about us.

The Ritual,Drama,"I’m guessing that Russell Crowe was busy for this latest exercise in priestly exorcism so an hardly recognisable Al Pacino decided to have a go. He is a Capetian father drafted in to help the reluctant Fr. Joseph (Dan Stevens) with a particularly difficult task. Fr. Theophilus must help rid the poor young Emma (Abigail Cowen) of an unwanted bodily guest. His methods do not impress the rather naive young father, nor the sisters in attendance as she increasingly resorts to involuntary bleeding, foul language, violent outbursts and even the usual hanging upside down from the ceiling lamp trick whilst under relentless assault from the repetitious bible verses being read across what I counted are at least seven of those ritual attempts at expulsion. Sound familiar? Well that’s because it is. Aside from Pacino turning in a slightly different style of performance from his norm, the rest of this hasn’t an original bone in it’s body. Indeed, its only claim to fame appears to be that it is based on the original, almost century old, transcriptions from Fr. Joseph of events that are really supposed to have happened but we’ve seen this all predictably play out so many times before that even the traditional collapsible bed doesn’t turn an head - spiritual or metaphysically. The one element that does provoke a little interest is, perhaps, the clear indication that Catholicism in the 1920s was riddled with incantations, superstitions and a degree of symbolism that probably hadn’t changed since much since there was a Borgia on the throne of St. Peter. This might work on the telly at Halloween of you’re full of Grappa, but as a cinema experience it is disappointing and entirely forgettable, sorry.",guessing russell crowe busy latest exercise priestly exorcism hardly recognisable al pacino decided go capetian father drafted help reluctant fr joseph dan stevens particularly difficult task fr theophilus must help rid poor young emma abigail cowen unwanted bodily guest methods impress rather naive young father sisters attendance increasingly resorts involuntary bleeding foul language violent outbursts even usual hanging upside ceiling lamp trick whilst relentless assault repetitious bible verses read across counted least seven ritual attempts expulsion sound familiar well aside pacino turning slightly different style performance norm rest original bone body indeed claim fame appears based original almost century old transcriptions fr joseph events really supposed happened seen predictably play many times even traditional collapsible bed turn head spiritual metaphysically one element provoke little interest perhaps clear indication catholicism riddled incantations superstitions degree symbolism probably changed since much since borgia throne st peter might work telly halloween full grappa cinema experience disappointing entirely forgettable sorry,Positive

The Twisters,Drama,"The 2024 The Twisters is an exciting but flawed disaster film that offers moments of thrilling action alongside noticeable weaknesses. While it’s entertaining and even educational at times, it’s held back by subpar visual effects and a weak script that undercuts the potential of its unique premise.

The movie does a good job of capturing the chaos and danger of tornadoes, and it’s engaging enough to keep you watching. However, the characters feel underdeveloped, making it hard to connect with their struggles. The visual effects, crucial in a film about natural disasters, often fall short of being convincing, which weakens the impact of the tornado sequences.

365 Days: This Day,Drama,"Undoubtedly still awful viewing, but... I found it a tiny bit more watchable than its predecessor.

<em>'365 Days: This Day'</em> still has nothing that even closely resembles a plot, still has extremely limited actors and still shouldn't even exist. However, I'd be lying if I said I disliked it as much as the 2020 original. It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!

Unlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else!  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

There's even some minor neat cinematography, too. The positives I note are minimal, though, and don't overly help this 2022 production. I have more negatives, which also include an overlong run time and that shoddy ending. At least it marginally improves upon the film it follows, I wonder if its own sequel will do likewise?

Oh, that's beautiful: two people (?) sitting in the sunset, both beautiful, the guy has a tattoo on his palm, nowhere else (Redflag!!), she stares deeply in love at his quivering lips. The male lead looks as if the coke delivery from the wholesaler hasn't arrived, she's naked again. And then, wow, that look - like someone fell asleep on Instagram's sepia filter slider. Everything looks so beautifully even.

In addition, the lovely sounds of the best that the German charts have to offer jingle from positions 58 to 72. Is it always the same song? Or lots of them that always sound the same? Is it even music or has someone kicked the neighbor's cat in the shin again? I don't know it. But no time to think. One of the mega hot soft sex games is just beginning, which is always really nasty and unpleasant.

It's sooo romantic. She says “Fuck me”, he says nothing as usual, but his look has now changed from a coke hit to a stroke. And then he licks it. Oh, great. With the whole tongue, once across the face and the adjacent table leg. Luckily, the endless banter is filmed in super slow motion, so the torture...cinematic ecstasy lasts much, much longer.

Suddenly he says... no, that's not true, he doesn't say anything. We only speak here in emergencies. Even if there's probably some kind of mafia plot being told, which I overlooked in all the constant fucking around. Unfortunately, I didn't understand who all these people were until the end. Well, of course it's stupid that I didn't see the first part, but it's also a little bit unusual that this sequel doesn't make any effort to give these characters any depth. Or to explain what is actually going on here. Is anything even going on? Well, it doesn't matter. The guys are supposed to be cute and the women are supposed to be persistent and stupid. And oh - they start slobbering on each other again 😍😍😍

365 Days: This Day,Drama,"If I were in the mood to watch adult content, Netflix would definitely not be my first choice. The movie I stumbled upon was a total disaster, making me extremely uncomfortable, especially when children unexpectedly walked into the room. It was a messy experience that I strongly advise against.

""365 Days"" seems to be all about sex and trying to engage the audience solely on that basis. The sequel follows the same pattern, and both films are filled with excessive plot holes, acting issues, and seem to lack a meaningful storyline. It feels like they are veering towards the wrong direction, almost resembling pornography rather than a film with substance.

Despite being somewhat enjoyable, these movies left me questioning why they were even made. I only watched the sequel because I had seen the first one and felt compelled to review both at the same time, even though I found them both to be quite terrible.",mood watch adult content netflix would definitely first choice movie stumbled upon total disaster making extremely uncomfortable especially children unexpectedly walked room messy experience strongly advise days seems sex trying engage audience solely basis sequel follows pattern films filled excessive plot holes acting issues seem lack meaningful storyline feels like veering towards wrong direction almost resembling pornography rather film substance despite somewhat enjoyable movies left questioning even made watched sequel seen first one felt compelled review time even though found quite terrible,Negative
Interstellar,Drama,"Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.

As we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.

It all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.

As I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.

The first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.

There are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.

‘‘This world's a treasure,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’

All the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.

Remember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.

Anyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.

I could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.

‘‘Maybe we've spent too long
trying to figure all this out with theory.’’

The end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.

The visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.

It will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",well one two year expected movies alongside battle five armies like chris nolan fans equally excited see movie opening day opening show slightly disappointed digital film agree science fiction dramatized usual space travel stories adventure thriller almost hour long stretch movie waste much time take us core story get prepared extremely rare voyage space logical explanation everything see screen well done research matured intelligent writing credit must go nolan brothers good sign jonathan nolan make big entertainment industry future like brother know many liked inception simple multi layered action movie stuffs used film makes sense fact little knowledge universe works easy catch scene situations watching movie totally like documentary style concept additional stuffs like characters emotions add flavor gives movie look educational movie though also work wants entertainment slow movie pace would test patience begins like shyamalan signs movie family living surrounded corn field switches astronaut farmer going gravity finally meets inception reference call movie setting brings constant change every half hour like opening scene end scene years difference earlier said story family alongside future humankind decoding universal mysteries travelling space time movie would reasonable thought space odyssey boring piece cleverly written cinematic piece especially science geeks know perfect movie actual present astrophysics justify common people capacity understanding encourageable amount commercial elements entertain well first three quarters movie well made puts unblinkable position like story narrated brian cox television series like said lots astrophysics involved strangely human emotions also exhibited equally never expected one nolan film ordinary sentiment strong enough make man cry happy sad situations movie liked science emotion coming together fact saved movie otherwise would science documentary straight nasa production nolan direction many surprise elements movie course twist end call series twists like layers compared last quarter movie rest completely detaches opens broadly different directions happens fast rushing towards end give impression movie inception perfect way say first tree life remains inception world treasure telling us leave actors good matthew mcconaughey steals show dominates majority screen space story presentation ruling fine performance executions anne hathaway young star twilight movie mackenzie foy remaining cast less scope like guest appearances widened little broader perfectly fitted story especially matt damon crucial one remember movie contact lovely movie ruined fictional ending something like happened film well story initiated realistic approach actual scientific contents per present understanding universe end let layered contents kind impossible agree cinematic theme worked yeah good solution wonderfully written story know time run backwards trouble anyway movie defines new way mean scientifically existence ghost horror movie liked supernatural force merged science fiction theme explains gives vast ideas expand physics beyond something somewhere yet reach hats director thinking making money idea implement humans understood far cosmos nicely transformed silver screen blend human emotions opinion replace space odyssey sometime till another one make way could asked better space travel drama especially heard nolan science fiction believed gon na rock true science human feelings film seen enough movies like one recall memories like tom hanks parts cloud atlas still independently stands strong falls never seen category maybe spent long trying figure theory end scene leaves hint possible sequel would happy happen near future definitely would completely different cinema per one ended know fans want happen visuals great simply good see digital would given us different experience sadly nolan favor technology hoping movie would get many oscars nod especially getting best motion picture shortlist would shame like said one fan love watching everyone every movie would went see converted digital since modern tech geek comes films become talk week perhaps month world leave behind friends talk gon na say must see asap movie fanatic like otherwise nolan movies need anyone recommendation movies usually sell like hot samosa,Negative
Interstellar,Drama,"People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. 
Interstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.
I remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. 
Since then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated.

Interstellar,Drama,"Another grandiloquent movie from Christoper Nolan.

The cast is good, and McConaughey performs a role made for himself. The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...

* The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.
* There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.
* To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.

Interstellar,Drama,"""Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.""

IT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.

This movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.

The premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.

Mathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.

Interstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.

The visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end.

Alas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.

With all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.

Interstellar,Drama,"This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed. 

The story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.

But what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. 

My only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.

Interstellar,Drama,"That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.

Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.

The movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.

The story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!

The movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.

The movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?

The one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.",movie time writing holds rating imdb simply beyond understanding needless say really like movie story good science ludicrous visuals impressive maybe latter would better big theater watched home cinema system relatively large screen european standards really sure either warned rest review might contain spoiler two movie starts usual told wet dream green fanatics dying earth depressing start right away overused concept today far concerned pour school official claiming apollo missions moon landings never happened f wanted depress audience right start succeeded least audience story proceeds heroes finding gravity waves sand huge stretch imagination decrypts mean coordinates leads secret nasa base cooper told best choice pilot save human race mission wormhole yeah right guy former nasa whereabouts could hardly unknown best choice would entrust mission save human race someone else stumbled onto door typical hollywood nonsense movie full kind rubbish romilly wastes years life pretty much nothing except deciding go sleep capsule supposedly highly trained vetted professor find turns psychopath well idiot almost blowing ship trying proceed docking systems tells succeeded proceed dock main ship stop spin well bring orbit around planet shuttles engines one hell powerful shuttle mention strength docking mechanism goes someone something illogical stupid sit around talking philosophizing dragging movie forward snails pace minutes way much movie movie ends one big time travel mess okay travel time sends messages time still bunch psychedelic scenes traveling back hole science much totally ludicrous massively illogical inefficient robot design one good thing say movie performance actors especially matthew mcconaughey quite good rest cup tea,Negative

Interstellar is my favorite movie. I'm really into space and everything about it, so this movie was my cup of tea. 
The soundtrack is the best of the movie. It points out flow of time, which is the most discussed issue in the movie. Special effects are breathtaking. Even with some small mistakes, it is pretty accurate and expectable. There is some visually pleasing cinematography too, including Saturn, the curvature of spacetime or majestic black hole, which is really satisfying. Some scenes are loud and thrilling, but some moments are so quiet, that you actually think, you are in space!
The movie is long but gripping. The plot, although it's complicated, is told easily and understandably. But the end of the movie is difficult to understand, since it contains time loop and time travel at the same time, but if you listen carefully, you will get it.

Interstellar,Drama,"""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light"".

The story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.

Christopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he's next film. And then comes a movie called ""Interstellar"" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience I've had at the cinema.

I saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.

The visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won an Oscar yet.

Now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it.

My only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for.

Interstellar,Drama,"I will not add another in depth review to the several I see here on this movie. Nor will I try to evaluate the accuracy of the science behind the plot. Apparently a physicist was involved who had veto power if the script wandered out of the realm of what is at least theoretically true or possible.

But I have never let inaccuracies get in the way of enjoying science fiction movies anyway, as long as the movie is entertaining and otherwise doesn’t insult my intelligence. In the movie Monsters, for example, I read that giant the aliens looking like octopuses could not have walked upright. Fair enough, but it is entertainment, not a documentary.

So the human story of Interstellar held my attention in spite of the length of the film, and despite the elaborate special effects, that story drove the movie and my appreciation of it. I have always liked good time travel movies as well, and theories of space and time come into play in Interstellar as well.

Interstellar,Drama,"As humanity faces an existential crisis, farmer ""Cooper"" (Matthew McConaughey) and his family are fighting a losing battle against an environment determined to destroy what is left of their corn crop. Mystery arrives after a sand storm leaves some magnetic clues to a secret location inhabited by NASA scientists led by ""Brand"" (Sir Michael Caine) who manage to convince former pilot ""Coop"" to join a mission to go into space and, using a recently detected wormhole that he believes may have been deliberately sent to help mankind rescue itself, set off to find another home for us all. Leaving a seriously narked daughter behind, he accepts the mission and together with the daughter of ""Brand"" (Anne Hathaway) their perilous trek begins. This is a more solid sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan. Though it features doses of his usual time bending scenarios, for the most part it is an exciting action film with mishaps a-plenty as their mission sees danger at just about every junction. There is a decent chemistry between Hathaway and McConaughey allowing the characters to develop with some depth that helps to draw us into to their efforts. The visual effects are superb, it has TARS - a rather clunkily designed robot that proves a whizz when running and rescuing, and the ending has something of the Escher drawing to it. The narrative can be thought provoking offering quite an interesting series of choices, especially when Matt Damon (""Mann"") joins the story and begins to challenge their approach to just what ""humanity"" might actually be! A host of celebrated co-stars prop it up well. John Lithgow is effective as the patriarch of the family and Casey Affleck and Wes Bentley help diffuse the intensity of the principal relationship as the space-bound menace gradually accumulates.

Interstellar,Drama,"What a cracker!

So glad to finally tick <em>'Interstellar'</em> off my theoretical list, took me far too long to get around to it but boy am I glad I finally have done - sensational film! The most obvious sign of that being the case is how the ~2hr30min run time goes by in an absolute flash... <em>*insert joke about it like being aboard Endurance here*</em>

I'm obviously not able to add anything new to what many, many others have already said gushingly about this 2014 flick, so I can only say I'm sure I agree with the vast majority of whatever praise this has received. As one would expect from Christopher Nolan & Co., it's incredibly well made, sounds amazing and looks out-of-this-world (ha!) stunning.

Matthew McConaughey puts in an incredible performance as lead, most notably nailing all of the emotion-filled scenes - not that I care about these things personally, but I'm shocked to see the lack of high accolades that came his way from this... he merited more! Aside from him, there are very good showings from the likes of Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy and Anne Hathaway.

I will note one 'but', mind. I didn't love the bits at the end involving the dimensional tesseract, don't get me wrong at all it's still superb viewing... just a noticeable drop from all that preceeds it, which honestly simply says more about how outstanding everything else prior is really. I thought similarly about (the equally magnificent) <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/"" rel=""nofollow"">Everything Everywhere All at Once</a>'</em>, for example.

Interstellar,Drama,"Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" (2014) isn't just a science fiction film; it's a cinematic experience that transcends genre boundaries. It's a breathtaking exploration of humanity's yearning for survival, the profound power of love, and the awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe.

The film's greatest strength lies in its seamless blend of a deeply personal story with cutting-edge scientific concepts. We follow Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot turned farmer, who is chosen to lead a mission to find a new home for humanity. The film doesn't shy away from complex scientific ideas like wormholes, black holes, and the theory of relativity, but it presents them in a way that is both accessible and captivating. The scene where Cooper encounters his aged daughter while he himself remains relatively young is a poignant example of how the film masterfully intertwines science and emotion, leaving viewers pondering the nature of time and the enduring power of familial bonds.

""Interstellar"" is not for the casual viewer. It demands attention, patience, and a willingness to engage with complex ideas. The film's pacing is deliberate, its visuals are stunningly immersive, and its themes are profound. It's a film that rewards repeated viewings, as each watch unveils new layers of meaning and scientific detail. The film's impact is further amplified by Hans Zimmer's haunting score, which perfectly captures the vastness of space and the weight of humanity's fate.

Nolan's direction is masterful, creating a sense of awe and wonder that is both captivating and emotionally resonant. McConaughey delivers a nuanced performance as Cooper, a man grappling with the weight of his mission and the sacrifices he must make. The supporting cast, including Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, also deliver compelling performances that further elevate the film's emotional impact.

""Interstellar"" is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's a testament to the power of human ingenuity, the enduring nature of love, and the endless possibilities that lie beyond our planet. It's a film that reminds us of our place in the universe, and the profound interconnectedness of all things.

Interstellar,Drama,"""Interstellar"" is easily one of the best movies I’ve ever watched, definitely in my top 5 of all time. It’s a masterpiece that feels like every scene matters. Each moment carries an important message, whether it’s about love, sacrifice, or the endless curiosity of humans to explore the unknown. It’s not just a movie, it’s an experience.

The performances by the actors were amazing. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper really made me feel every bit of his emotions; his love for his kids, his struggle, and his determination to save humanity. Anne Hathaway also nailed her role, and Jessica Chastain, as adult Murph, was just perfect. Even the smaller roles added so much depth to the movie. It felt like everyone gave their absolute best.

Christopher Nolan’s direction? Flawless. You can see how much thought and care he put into every part of the movie. The production was top-notch, and the visuals of space were breathtaking. Even the robots, TARS and CASE, felt real and practical, not just fancy CGI. Fun fact: those robots were real models controlled by an actor, which is crazy to think about! The black hole, Gargantua, was also scientifically accurate thanks to physicist Kip Thorne, and it looked stunning on screen.

The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer deserves its own shoutout. The way he used the church organ and ticking sounds created a mood that’s unforgettable. It felt like the music was alive and part of the story, pulling me deeper into every scene.

The movie also taught me things. I love how it’s based on real science, like time dilation and wormholes, but it doesn’t feel boring or like a science lesson. Instead, it made me curious and left me thinking long after it ended.

One thing that stood out for me is how the movie shows the power of love and connection. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph was the heart of the story for me. It reminded me that even in the vastness of space, what truly matters are the people we care about.

""Interstellar"" isn’t just about saving the world; it’s about what it means to be human. Watching it makes you think about big questions: Why are we here? What’s our purpose? And how far are we willing to go for the ones we love? It’s rare to find a movie that’s this entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking all at the same time.

This is the kind of movie I could watch over and over again and still find new details to appreciate. It’s honestly hard to put into words how much I love it, but if you’ve seen it, you know what I mean.

The Marching Band,Drama,"“Thibaut” (Benjamin Lavernhe) is an accomplished conductor who is now based in the USA but who comes home to France now and again to perform. It’s during one such visit that he confides to his sister “Rose” (Mathilde Courcol-Rozés) that he needs a bone-marrow transplant. She readily agrees to help out but when she is found to be incompatible, that news opens quite a can of worms that results in him having to ask “Jimmy” (Pierre Lottin) - a brother he didn’t know he had and who lives in a quietly dying town where his workplace is earmarked for closure, to help out. Initially uninterested and disbelieving, the film now illustrates just how the two men come to terms with their past, their present and (hopefully) their future against a backdrop of resentment and privilege as they try to reconcile with the elements of “luck of the draw” that have governed their lives thus far. Fortunately, they have one thing in common. They both love music, and as it transpires that “Jimmy” plays trombone in his local mineworkers band we have a conduit for them to bond - or not! There are shades of “Brassed Off” (1996) as this offers us a social commentary on the decline of traditional rural industries that leave little by way of hope or opportunity in it’s wake; a little bit of romance and some seriously horrible uniforms too! Along the way, there is also some fine classical Mozart, some crooning from Charles Aznavour and some enjoyable band rehearsals with an eclectic collection of the townsfolk proving remarkably talented with instrument and voice alike - after a soupçon of guidance. No, there probably isn’t so much jeopardy about the denouement, though there is a twist - it’s really a story about family and one that’s presented without too much sentiment and a bit of enjoyably bloody-minded Gallic humour.

The Shawshank Redemption,Drama,very good movie 9.5/10 محمد الشعراوى,good movie,Positive
The Shawshank Redemption,Drama,"Some birds aren't meant to be caged.

The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.

It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.

Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.

The Shawshank Redemption,Drama,"Tim Robbins is wealthy banker ""Andy Dufresne"" who finds himself sentenced to life imprisonment after his wife and her lover are found murdered. The handsome ""new fish"" is initially the target of the ""sisters"" who would use him as they would like - but he fights back and gradually establishes a friendship with prison ""scrounger"" Morgan Freeman (""Red""). When he overhears the beastly prison guard captain bemoaning some tax problems, he, rather riskily, volunteers to help find a tax-free solution and is soon advising pretty much the whole place - including ""Warden Norton"" (Bob Gunton) on all things financial - some above board, some less so. The film is set over a period of over ten years, and depicts some of the most brutal aspects of prison life; but also some it's more hopeful. It deals with violence and desperation but also of bonding and lasting friendships and loyalties that long term close-confinement engender. Frank Darabont elicits the best from his three principals superbly, with added venom provided by guard captain Clancy Brown and humanity from prison librarian James Whitmore - one of the few who actually does make parole.

The Shawshank Redemption,Drama,"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those timeless classics that pulls you in with its heartfelt storytelling and remarkable performances. At its core, it’s a story about hope, friendship, and the resilience of the human spirit, set against the bleak backdrop of Shawshank prison. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red deliver deeply moving performances, capturing the bond that grows between two men confined by walls but freed by hope. Every scene feels purposeful, and the script, adapted from Stephen King’s novella, is simply brilliant in how it weaves small moments into a powerful narrative.

One of the most unforgettable parts of the movie is Brooks’ storyline. Watching him leave the world he knew, only to find himself unable to adapt to a society that had progressed beyond his comprehension, is heartbreaking every time. It’s a stark reminder of how institutionalization can strip people of their ability to live freely, even after they've served their time. That moment, along with Red’s own journey, adds a bittersweet layer of realism to the story’s broader themes of freedom and redemption.

The direction by Frank Darabont is masterful, turning what could have been a straightforward prison drama into something deeply profound. The setting of Shawshank feels both oppressive and oddly serene, perfectly capturing the tone of the story. The simplicity of the plot is its strength, allowing the characters and their emotional arcs to take center stage.

The Substance,Drama,"The Substance delivers an intense, visually mesmerizing commentary on the entertainment industry's obsession with youth and outward beauty. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley offer remarkable, maybe even career-best performances, with Dennis Quaid excelling in his role as well. Coralie Fargeat explores how aging stars, particularly women, are discarded when they no longer meet the industry's strict beauty standards. Moore's character, haunted by the memory of her former fame and beauty, goes down a dark path in pursuit of a ""better"" version of herself. The story is also a sharp critique of power dynamics, with white men controlling who's in front of the spotlight, while women are pitted against one another for validation.

The film's production is equally impressive, especially the makeup and prosthetic work that elevates its body horror elements. While the first half of the movie is more subdued, the gore ramps up significantly as the plot unfolds, culminating in a chaotic ""fourth act"" that will leave audiences bewildered. The fast-paced editing, paired with an impactful score, heightens the tension and surrealism of the narrative. Though there's a part of me who prefers a version of the film that ends before the wild final act, the overall experience is an unforgettable, audacious exploration of vanity, control, and desperation in the entertainment world.

The Substance,Drama,"For a film that’s laser-focused on the human body, it’s gloriously on point that THE SUBSTANCE begins with a freshly cracked, bright yellow egg yolk. 

Eggs are the ‘giver of life’, right? They’re the origin of all of us. Gleaming and plump, the yolk suddenly gets pricked – not by a fork, but a syringe.

That’s the first juicy visual metaphor of many in this meaningfully bonkers body horror, for which French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat picked up the prestigious Best Screenplay prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.

To call the film ‘bold’ is a weapons-grade understatement. It’s an audacious, jaw-dropping examination of what screens & billboards demand of women (especially as they age), and how laughably impossible it is to meet those demands. Well, if you didn’t laugh, you’d cry. After watching THE SUBSTANCE, you might do both.

The Substance,Drama,"There’s a big difference between being funny and being laughable, yet the latest from writer-director Coralie Fargeat has somehow found a way to be both. After amassing a considerable amount of largely well-earned cinematic goodwill in the film’s opening segments, the picture mercilessly squanders that support in the final act with an overlong, meandering, disgustingly gratuitous and grotesque exhibition of utterly bad taste. This story of an aging actress (Demi Moore) who seeks to revive her career by retrieving some of her lost youth with the aid of an enigmatic injectable follows her grand misadventures when the mysterious substance prompts the emergence of a younger doppelganger (Margaret Qualley), who becomes a Hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight. To make this experimental venture work, however, the two individuals must follow a complex set of rules, dictates that become increasingly difficult to follow as they each vie for their respective shares of attention. And, as this scenario unfolds, tension grows between them, leading to complications and unexpected developments that become progressively harder to manage. But that’s where what works in the film ends. As the story plays out from there, it becomes stupendously absurd, and, even though there are some hearty laughs in this, there are even more ridiculously implausible and unexplained occurrences that try audience members’ patience and tolerance, so much so that I couldn’t wait for this trainwreck to end. In addition to the foregoing shortcomings, the film includes myriad changes in tone, making it difficult to determine whether this is supposed to be a serious thriller or a campy road, very much in the same way as in the incomprehensible French offering “Titane” (2021). It also shamelessly “borrows” elements from other movies in various ways, most notably imagery and narrative references from “The Shining” (1980) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), costume designs from the “Hunger Games” franchise, and bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts from films like “Vertigo” (1958). Then there’s the picture’s obvious, heavy-handed message about the perils of misogyny, observations that, as important as they are, could easily stood to have been turned down more than a few notches (yes, we get it already). At the same time, though, there are also some fundamentally innate questions about the narrative that go wholly unanswered, leaving us with numerous head-scratching moments. Sadly, these failings detract significantly from the elements that do work (at least early on in the film), such as the fine performances of Moore and Qualley, the picture’s inventive cinematography, and a central premise that could have made for an engaging story if handled with greater finesse. But these strengths are effectively cancelled by what ultimately results when this release goes off the rails. Indeed, how “The Substance” captured the 2024 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay is truly mind boggling. I’m certainly a fan of the weird, wild and wacky, but this release undermines the virtues of those cherished qualities. Regrettably, I was seriously looking forward to seeing this offering, and I was decidedly impressed by what I saw in its opening acts, but that was all wiped out by how this one ultimately played out, a picture that, in the end, ironically relied more on style than “substance.”",big difference funny laughable yet latest writer director coralie fargeat somehow found way amassing considerable amount largely well earned cinematic goodwill film opening segments picture mercilessly squanders support final act overlong meandering disgustingly gratuitous grotesque exhibition utterly bad taste story aging actress demi moore seeks revive career retrieving lost youth aid enigmatic injectable follows grand misadventures mysterious substance prompts emergence younger doppelganger margaret qualley becomes hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight make experimental venture work however two individuals must follow complex set rules dictates become increasingly difficult follow vie respective shares attention scenario unfolds tension grows leading complications unexpected developments become progressively harder manage works film ends story plays becomes stupendously absurd even though hearty laughs even ridiculously implausible unexplained occurrences try audience members patience tolerance much wait trainwreck end addition foregoing shortcomings film includes myriad changes tone making difficult determine whether supposed serious thriller campy road much way incomprehensible french offering titane also shamelessly borrows elements movies various ways notably imagery narrative references shining young frankenstein costume designs hunger games franchise bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts films like vertigo picture obvious heavy handed message perils misogyny observations important could easily stood turned notches yes get already time though also fundamentally innate questions narrative go wholly unanswered leaving us numerous head scratching moments sadly failings detract significantly elements work least early film fine performances moore qualley picture inventive cinematography central premise could made engaging story handled greater finesse strengths effectively cancelled ultimately results release goes rails indeed substance captured cannes film festival award best screenplay truly mind boggling certainly fan weird wild wacky release undermines virtues cherished qualities regrettably seriously looking forward seeing offering decidedly impressed saw opening acts wiped one ultimately played picture end ironically relied style substance,Positive
The Substance,Drama,"This takes a logical step on from Coralie Fargeat's earlier ""Reality+"" (2014) drama, only this time it takes a much more substantial swipe at all things vain. ""Elisabeth"" (Demi Moore) has been at the top of her fitness game for many a year when her boss ""Harvey"" (Dennis Quaid) decides that she's now too old and that a younger model is needed to present those programmes we all saw on the television of gorgeous, fit and healthy, people showing us how to exercise on a mat in from of our televisions each morning. Distracted by her imminent removal, she is involved in a car accident that introduces her to an handsome young nurse (Robin Grear) and then to a curious invitation to test out a mysterious fluid that can essentially give her her cake and eat it. In best ""Jekyll and Hyde"" tradition, injecting this quite literally creates a split personality. One is her current self, the other a perfect, younger specimen. They work in a rota system each gets a week of consciousness then has to take a week out. Thing is, the more vivacious character ""Sue"" (Margaret Qualley) is not so religious about sticking to these sharing rules and we quickly discover that what is ""borrowed"" can never been returned - with increasingly harrowing results. With the gushing ""Harvey"" determined to capitalise on his new ratings winner, things become decidedly irritating for the now marginalised ""Elisabeth"" - but shat can she do? There's no going back...! I think this is Moore at her best. Her palpable sense of evolving fury, exasperation and frustration is expertly captured as is the selfishness of her alter ego by an on form Qualley. Quaid steals his scenes as the truly odious epitome of corporate greed for whom it's all about the business, the money and never the actual people concerned. The denouement is reminiscent of something concocted by one of the David's - Lynch or Cronenberg, and allows the throbbing ghastliness of this story of vanity gone mad to demonstrate just how fickle life can be when there's little actual substance at all to their shallow and vacuous lives.

The Substance,Drama,"Certainly an experience!

<em>'The Substance'</em> is <b>a lot</b>. It's one of those sorta movies that I needed to let settle in my mind before I even started to think about reviewing it. I'm not even sure where to start. It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!

I think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, which I found to be solid enough but it came across, at least to me, as a bit too forced for shock value. This 2024 release has plenty of that, if not more, but it somehow feels totally at home with what surrounds it.

The story itself is fascinating, even taking out all the craziness with the gore et al. So by no means is this a film that is style over substance (sorry). It isn't anything actually overly original in terms of the base plotline, though the way it is portrayed and brought to life is astounding - every inch is expertly crafted.

Demi Moore is outstanding in this! I haven't seen her in much, at least anything released post-2002, but here she is top quality throughout. Margaret Qualley is obviously the opposite in terms of the former, though is just as fantastic in regards to the latter - great performance!

The Substance,Drama,"**The Substance (2024)**
A Visceral Exploration of Youth Obsession and the Fear of Time

""The Substance"" is a bold cinematic experience that masterfully resurrects the practical effects of 1980s horror, delivering a visual and auditory feast that is both nostalgic and groundbreaking. Directed with a keen eye for detail, the film delves deep into society's obsession with youth and the inevitable passage of time, offering a thought-provoking commentary wrapped in visceral horror.
The film follows a renowned actress, portrayed by Demi Moore, who grapples with the fear of aging and losing her fame. In a desperate attempt to reclaim her youth, she becomes entangled with a mysterious substance that promises vitality but comes with horrifying consequences. As she navigates this treacherous path, the lines between reality and obsession blur, leading to a descent into madness.
At its core, ""The Substance"" is a critique of the 21st-century fixation on youth over the value of life experience. It echoes themes from classics like ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""The Picture of Dorian Gray,"" highlighting the shame associated with aging and the societal pressure to maintain perpetual youthfulness. The film questions whether society promotes a 'sexy reality' at the expense of genuine substance and wisdom.
The narrative explores the concept of cheating death, not just literally but metaphorically, as a fear of social death—being forgotten or replaced. This is poignantly portrayed through Moore's character, who embodies the desperation of clinging to relevance in a world that idolizes the new and discards the old.

**Practical Effects and Gore**
From the opening scenes, it's evident that the physical effects are a labor of love—a homage to the era before CGI dominated horror. The gore is unapologetically front and center, reminiscent of Cronenberg's ""The Fly,"" pushing the boundaries of on-screen grotesque. The disturbingly realistic blood effects, combined with meticulously crafted sound design, amplify the discomfort, making the audience squirm.

**Color Palette and Visual Aesthetics**
The color palette is meticulously crafted, bathing scenes in hues that evoke unease and familiarity simultaneously. The use of shadows and lighting enhances the suspense, while the wardrobe and costume design serve as narrative devices, illustrating the juxtaposition between youth and age, purity and corruption.

**Performances**
Demi Moore delivers a stellar performance, capturing the vulnerability and desperation of a woman battling the relentless march of time. Her portrayal adds depth to the film's themes, embodying the internal decay and obsession manifesting physically through the substance. The supporting cast also contributes significantly, with each character representing different facets of society's views on youth and aging.

**Critique**
While the film excels in many areas, it isn't without flaws. The ending feels abrupt, leaving several narrative threads untied, which may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Additionally, the persistent focus on teen emotional states can be grating, potentially alienating those seeking a more mature exploration of the presented themes.

**Engaging with the Hype**
""The Substance"" has generated significant buzz online, sparking discussions about its innovative use of practical effects and its deep societal commentary. The hype seems to stem from both horror enthusiasts who appreciate the throwback to classic techniques and audiences resonating with its timely themes. However, it's worth considering whether the film is merely feeding into the very cycle of superficiality it aims to criticize.


""The Substance"" is a visceral commentary on the fear of aging, the obsession with youth, and the inevitable march of time. It challenges viewers to reflect on their perceptions of age, experience, and what truly holds value. By drawing parallels with films like ""Gremlins,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" and ""Carrie,"" it positions itself as a modern amalgamation of timeless themes.
Despite its imperfections, the film succeeds in sparking conversation—a hallmark of impactful cinema. It's as uncomfortable as it is thought-provoking, demanding to be felt and discussed. Whether you love it or hate it, ""The Substance"" is a noteworthy addition to the horror genre that holds up a mirror to society's own fears and obsessions.

**Extra Thoughts**
- The film raises pertinent questions about our role in perpetuating the fear of aging. Are we complicit in creating a world where experience is devalued?
- The character dynamics suggest that embracing change and maintaining balance might be key to a fulfilling life, even if it comes at a cost.
- The hype surrounding the movie could reflect its resonance with audiences grappling with similar fears and obsessions in today's youth-centric culture.

**Final Recommendation**
""The Substance"" may not offer all the answers, but it provides a platform for dialogue on important societal issues. Its blend of classic horror techniques with contemporary themes makes it a film worth experiencing. If you're a fan of thought-provoking horror that goes beyond mere scares, this movie deserves a place on your watchlist.",substance visceral exploration youth obsession fear time substance bold cinematic experience masterfully resurrects practical effects horror delivering visual auditory feast nostalgic groundbreaking directed keen eye detail film delves deep society obsession youth inevitable passage time offering thought provoking commentary wrapped visceral horror film follows renowned actress portrayed demi moore grapples fear aging losing fame desperate attempt reclaim youth becomes entangled mysterious substance promises vitality comes horrifying consequences navigates treacherous path lines reality obsession blur leading descent madness core substance critique st century fixation youth value life experience echoes themes classics like death becomes picture dorian gray highlighting shame associated aging societal pressure maintain perpetual youthfulness film questions whether society promotes sexy reality expense genuine substance wisdom narrative explores concept cheating death literally metaphorically fear social death forgotten replaced poignantly portrayed moore character embodies desperation clinging relevance world idolizes new discards old practical effects gore opening scenes evident physical effects labor love homage era cgi dominated horror gore unapologetically front center reminiscent cronenberg fly pushing boundaries screen grotesque disturbingly realistic blood effects combined meticulously crafted sound design amplify discomfort making audience squirm color palette visual aesthetics color palette meticulously crafted bathing scenes hues evoke unease familiarity simultaneously use shadows lighting enhances suspense wardrobe costume design serve narrative devices illustrating juxtaposition youth age purity corruption performances demi moore delivers stellar performance capturing vulnerability desperation woman battling relentless march time portrayal adds depth film themes embodying internal decay obsession manifesting physically substance supporting cast also contributes significantly character representing different facets society views youth aging critique film excels many areas without flaws ending feels abrupt leaving several narrative threads untied may leave viewers unsatisfied additionally persistent focus teen emotional states grating potentially alienating seeking mature exploration presented themes engaging hype substance generated significant buzz online sparking discussions innovative use practical effects deep societal commentary hype seems stem horror enthusiasts appreciate throwback classic techniques audiences resonating timely themes however worth considering whether film merely feeding cycle superficiality aims criticize substance visceral commentary fear aging obsession youth inevitable march time challenges viewers reflect perceptions age experience truly holds value drawing parallels films like gremlins frankenstein christmas carol carrie positions modern amalgamation timeless themes despite imperfections film succeeds sparking conversation hallmark impactful cinema uncomfortable thought provoking demanding felt discussed whether love hate substance noteworthy addition horror genre holds mirror society fears obsessions extra thoughts film raises pertinent questions role perpetuating fear aging complicit creating world experience devalued character dynamics suggest embracing change maintaining balance might key fulfilling life even comes cost hype surrounding movie could reflect resonance audiences grappling similar fears obsessions today youth centric culture final recommendation substance may offer answers provides platform dialogue important societal issues blend classic horror techniques contemporary themes makes film worth experiencing fan thought provoking horror goes beyond mere scares movie deserves place watchlist,Negative
The Substance,Drama,"""The Substance"" is something of a cinematic mash up. 

First off, this story is somewhat  reminiscent of ""Death Becomes Her"". The 1992 film starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. 

The notion of the fatal conceit in the search for eternal youth amongst the ageing Hollywood set is very much central to the story in both films.

That said, the handling is distinctly different. This film is a lot louder, gaudier, brasher, cruder and ruder, than its 90's counterpart by a country mile. There are elements I'd typically associate with Lovecraft too, that are grotesque, monstrous and disturbing. 

This work is also more a visually clever, as opposed to a compelling narrative based experience. Its messages are conveyed, like Hollywood itself, through larger than life youthful glitz and glamour but also an innate, ephemeral shallowness.A shallowness that becomes a kind of obsessive prison, denying those trapped in it, any meaningful form of human intimacy.

My only criticism of what I do feel is a very good film, is it overplays its hand. Its so over the top in the latter part of the film, I felt it partly drowned out the message, it had, up to that point, convincingly conveyed. The closing scenes. in particular, felt crude, clumsy and would have worked considerably better, with more controlled and subtle, handling. 

In summary, ""The Substance"" is a rather clever film that uses the eye of the lens to expose how what we see, in Hollywood at least, is more important than who we are. People are shiny commodities to be replaced when the beautiful image they portray starts to wither away. As we see, youth and beauty is everything, no matter the price. 

I will say too, this is by no means a perfect cinematic experience. It can be over the top, especially in the latter part of the film. That said, there is, on balance, more to like here than not. Definitely worth a look.",substance something cinematic mash first story somewhat reminiscent death becomes film starring meryl streep goldie hawn bruce willis notion fatal conceit search eternal youth amongst ageing hollywood set much central story films said handling distinctly different film lot louder gaudier brasher cruder ruder counterpart country mile elements typically associate lovecraft grotesque monstrous disturbing work also visually clever opposed compelling narrative based experience messages conveyed like hollywood larger life youthful glitz glamour also innate ephemeral shallowness shallowness becomes kind obsessive prison denying trapped meaningful form human intimacy criticism feel good film overplays hand top latter part film felt partly drowned message point convincingly conveyed closing scenes particular felt crude clumsy would worked considerably better controlled subtle handling summary substance rather clever film uses eye lens expose see hollywood least important people shiny commodities replaced beautiful image portray starts wither away see youth beauty everything matter price say means perfect cinematic experience top especially latter part film said balance like definitely worth look,Negative
The Substance,Drama,"A disaster. It's an insult to the illustrious careers of Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid, who both deserve far better.

The film focuses too heavily on the body of Margaret Qualley's character, Sue, at the expense of delivering a meaningful story or message. The gratuitous gore towards the end seems to be an attempt to align with current trends, but it falls flat.

""Gladiator II may not achieve the groundbreaking impact of the original film, but it remains an impressive cinematic experience, transporting audiences into an epic filled with emotional and visual grandeur.

Ridley Scott once again showcases his mastery in blending narrative, action, and thematic depth, delivering a sequel marked by superb technical execution and standout performances, particularly from Denzel Washington. Despite the inevitable comparisons to the classic, the iconic filmmaker presents a story that justifies its existence, even if it treads familiar ground.

Gladiator II,Drama,"_Gladiator II_, a polished echo of the original, is a testament to Ridley Scott's cinematic powers. It follows his hit-and-miss _Napoleon_ biopic last year, which was rather miss than hit. The sequel captures the original's essence while introducing elements, making it a worthy successor.

Paul Mescal in the lead role - inherited from the ever-growling Russel Crowe, who was at the top of his career in the original - holds his ground against Denzel Washington, whose charisma cleaves through the screen as effortlessly as his character's sword.

Ridley Scott admits he was prompted to revisit _Gladiator_ by the acclaim he received from those too young to have seen the original on the big screen. His mission to lure Gen Z away from their streaming devices may help to save cinema, ushering in a new era of appreciation for the big screen. But for the love of Jupiter, I hope they quickly learn that it isn't just a big iPad with comfy chairs. No pausing, swiping, mid-film selfies, dashes to the bar, or running commentary required.

Gladiator II,Drama,"<em>'Gladiator II'</em> is awesome!

I only watched the original three years ago, almost to the day in fact, but I was anticipating this follow-up after thoroughly loving the Russell Crowe film. Honestly, I think I kinda enjoyed this sequel more - at worst, the two are on the same level, for me anyway. Crowe is missed, though everyone in this movie more than makes up for his (obvious) absence.

This is the first time I've seen Paul Mescal act, despite knowing of him for quite a while now. I'm impressed! He delivers a showing of great strength (pardon the pun). Pedro Pascal is very good too, as is Joseph Quinn; I wasn't instantly sold on the latter when he appeared onscreen, though when all is said and done I rate his performance positively.

Denzel Washington... what a geezer. I'll never tire or turn down the chance at seeing that man act. Needless to say, given he's one of two favourite actors of mine, I loved his performance all the way through. The likes of Fred Hechinger and Connie Nielsen merit fair praise as well, interesting to see Rory McCann and Matt Lucas in there too.

Oh, and the score... superb! Deafeningly grand.",em gladiator ii em awesome watched original three years ago almost day fact anticipating follow thoroughly loving russell crowe film honestly think kinda enjoyed sequel worst two level anyway crowe missed though everyone movie makes obvious absence first time seen paul mescal act despite knowing quite impressed delivers showing great strength pardon pun pedro pascal good joseph quinn instantly sold latter appeared onscreen though said done rate performance positively denzel washington geezer never tire turn chance seeing man act needless say given one two favourite actors mine loved performance way likes fred hechinger connie nielsen merit fair praise well interesting see rory mccann matt lucas oh score superb deafeningly grand,Negative
Gladiator II,Drama,"Sixteen years after ""Maximus"" (Russell Crowe) bit the dust, we find ancient Rome under the control of twins ""Geta"" (Joseph Quinn) and his brother ""Caracalla"" (Fred Hechinger) and thanks to their general ""Acacias"" (Pedro Pascal) continuing to expand their empire. It's this latter man who leads an attack on the home ""Nanno"" (Paul Mescal) shares with his wife ""Arishat"" (Yuval Gonen). That doesn't go so well and next thing, she's gone on ahead of him to the wheat fields and he's now a slave owned by the manipulative ""Macrinus"" (Denzel Washington) heading to the Colosseum to entertain the emperors and their cousin ""Lucilla"" (Connie Nielsen). What now ensues is a well produced and good looking rehash of the first film paying homage en route to ""Spartacus"" and it's the sheer predicability that I struggled with. It's episodically delivered with far too much script and though Mescal tries hard, his performance is largely charm-free and as wooden as a rudius, especially once the rather far-fetched familial back-story has been established. Sir Derek Jacobi sparingly appears as the other survivor from 2000 reprising his role as the senator ""Gracchus"" but to no real effect and the scene stealer for me is really only the megalomanic Quinn's imperial offering as he and his bonkers sibling teeter on the brink of inbred, sexually fluid, madness. Washington does well enough as the scheming slave-master, but he hasn't really enough to work with to stand out amongst what really are a mediocre collection of undercooked characters that just don't deliver any real sense of the hedonism and menace of this debauched and corrupt state. As with Sir Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) the battle scenes are superb and action packed, as are the combat scenes in the vast marble auditorium filled with baying plebs and rhinos, but I am afraid that the shallow characterisations just didn't work well enough to keep this engaging and the plot was just too thin to stretch over a couple of hours that could have been so very much better.

Gladiator II,Drama,"Comparisons will be inevitable and Gladiator II will never be as iconic as the 2000 classic. However it is very good, strong all-around with gripping action and a well executed script. Performances are very good, with some pleasant surprises.",comparisons inevitable gladiator ii never iconic classic however good strong around gripping action well executed script performances good pleasant surprises,Negative
Gladiator II,Drama,"Gladiator II features some impressive action sequences. Every battle in the Colosseum is fantastic despite how historically inaccurate they may be. The monkey sequence showcases how skilled Hanno (Paul Mescal) is not only as a fighter but also in how he interacts with others. Then there's the rhino sequence that plays out much like Bugs Bunny’s interactions with Toro the Bull in the Chuck Jones-directed Looney Tunes short Bully for Bugs (1953).

While those sequences are fairly believable, the shark sequence seems like pure fantasy and that’s why it’s so incredible. They fill the Colosseum with water and let sharks loose while the opposing gladiators try to survive the onslaught on boats.

It’s also interesting to note that every major actor who dies in the film has a spectacular death. Not only that but these gruesome deaths get increasingly more grisly and memorable as the film progresses. These bloody triumphs rarely delve any deeper than someone getting shot with a bunch of arrows or a beheading or appendage severing of some kind. This level of brutality escalates throughout the film and eventually culminates with the most satisfying kill that takes two and a half hours to achieve.

The performances fluctuate between being top-tier perfection and mediocre overacting. Denzel Washington is having the time of his life as Macrinus. He has the most interesting storyline and Denzel dances in every scene with a giddiness that is unparalleled. Joseph Quinn seems to be acting in an entirely different film than everyone else as Emperor Geta. His mannerisms are operatic and theatrical with his wide eyes that rarely blink, grand body language and hand gestures, and explosive line delivery.

Pedro Pascal doesn’t do anything in Gladiator II as Marcus Acacius that he didn’t do in Game of Thrones apart from having more screen time. Much like how his character is written, Paul Mescal’s performance is muddled. The Hanno character and who he is is a poorly kept secret that consistently pulls the character in several directions.

Hanno is vengeful at first before succumbing to being the hero of the film and the evolution isn’t earned. The writing and pacing of Gladiator II feel like the film drops Hanno’s fate in his lap halfway through, which he’s either forgotten about over two decades or never knew until the audience did.

Connie Nielsen, one of the few returning actors from the original film, is awful in this. Her acting in Gladiator II always comes off as forced as her crying scenes are often portrayed as constipated grunts with crocodile tears. Her dialogue delivery is also strained and broken despite being given some of the most important sequences of character connections and reawakenings of sorts in the sequel.

Calling Gladiator II action-heavy is misleading because the film drags between every fight sequence. The film is largely dull and difficult to indulge during its quieter moments. The film is gorgeous with its incredible set pieces, intricate costume design, and impressive use of infinitely numerous extras. Director Ridley Scott reunites with all of the set decorators (Sonja Klaus, Crispian Sallis, and Emilio Ardura) and costume designer (Janty Yates) that he worked with on Gladiator in 2000. From a visual standpoint, Ridley Scott's films are highly detailed masterpieces.

Denzel Washington’s extravagant performance makes Gladiator II worthwhile. Still, not even its excessively violent action sequences, beautiful cinematography, and masterful set and costume design can save the sequel from how boring it is. Ridley Scott waited over twenty years to make a sequel that is more than twice as expensive as the original only to rehash the same story points.",gladiator ii features impressive action sequences every battle colosseum fantastic despite historically inaccurate may monkey sequence showcases skilled hanno paul mescal fighter also interacts others rhino sequence plays much like bugs bunny interactions toro bull chuck jones directed looney tunes short bully bugs sequences fairly believable shark sequence seems like pure fantasy incredible fill colosseum water let sharks loose opposing gladiators try survive onslaught boats also interesting note every major actor dies film spectacular death gruesome deaths get increasingly grisly memorable film progresses bloody triumphs rarely delve deeper someone getting shot bunch arrows beheading appendage severing kind level brutality escalates throughout film eventually culminates satisfying kill takes two half hours achieve performances fluctuate top tier perfection mediocre overacting denzel washington time life macrinus interesting storyline denzel dances every scene giddiness unparalleled joseph quinn seems acting entirely different film everyone else emperor geta mannerisms operatic theatrical wide eyes rarely blink grand body language hand gestures explosive line delivery pedro pascal anything gladiator ii marcus acacius game thrones apart screen time much like character written paul mescal performance muddled hanno character poorly kept secret consistently pulls character several directions hanno vengeful first succumbing hero film evolution earned writing pacing gladiator ii feel like film drops hanno fate lap halfway either forgotten two decades never knew audience connie nielsen one returning actors original film awful acting gladiator ii always comes forced crying scenes often portrayed constipated grunts crocodile tears dialogue delivery also strained broken despite given important sequences character connections reawakenings sorts sequel calling gladiator ii action heavy misleading film drags every fight sequence film largely dull difficult indulge quieter moments film gorgeous incredible set pieces intricate costume design impressive use infinitely numerous extras director ridley scott reunites set decorators sonja klaus crispian sallis emilio ardura costume designer janty yates worked gladiator visual standpoint ridley scott films highly detailed masterpieces denzel washington extravagant performance makes gladiator ii worthwhile still even excessively violent action sequences beautiful cinematography masterful set costume design save sequel boring ridley scott waited twenty years make sequel twice expensive original rehash story points,Negative

Gladiator II,Drama,"When Ridley Scott decided to revisit Gladiator, it sounded like an opportunity to expand on one of the greatest historical epics. Instead, we got a rehash that feels more like a missed opportunity than a bold sequel.

The first act rushes through familiar territory. A general, born out of combat, loses his family and ends up as a slave. Sound familiar? It’s the same setup as Maximus’s story, minus the emotional weight. And sending Lucilla’s son away to protect him? That’s not just a weak plot point, it spits on everything Maximus and Marcus died for.

The second act brings nothing new to the table. The “twist” is predictable, the plot messy, and the villains uninspired. Commodus worked because he was layered, a mix of insecurity and cruelty. Here, the two emperors are generic placeholders. Even the attempted coup feels like déjà vu, with none of the intensity or buildup that made the first movie iconic.

The third act delivers a visually stunning battle but lacks substance. The final showdown offers nothing fresh, and the death of the antagonist in front of everyone feels like it’s trying to copy the original. The speech about “Maximus and Marcus’s dream”? We’ve heard it before, and it meant more the first time.

What was the point of that last scene? There were so many ways to end this movie with a high note, something meaningful to honor Lucilla or Acacius. Instead, we get a hollow, pointless ending that adds nothing to the story.

Credit where it’s due: the cinematography, CGI, and score are outstanding. Visually, the movie is a masterpiece, with breathtaking scenery and polished editing. The music, while clearly inspired by the original, carries the mood well. But great visuals can’t save a story that refuses to move forward.

Until Dawn,Drama,"Sadly, there really isn’t much new to say about this derivative horror film. It’s the usual bunch of friends in the car routine, only this time it’s a woman-hunt they are on. You see, “Melanie” whom we very briefly meet at the start - has gone missing and so her sister “Clover” (Ella Rubin) has recruited her ex “Max” (Michael Cimino), best pal “Nina” (Odessa A’zion) and her new boyfriend “Abe” (Belmont Cameli) and the slightly spiritual “Megan” (Ji-young Yoo) to try to find out what happened. As the song goes: “if you go into the woods tonight, you’re in for a big surprise…” and so dodgy and ill-conceived decisions galore now ensue as the usual set-piece housebound horror kicks in and the story sort of lurches around like a gory version of “Groundhog Day”. The acting and writing vie for the award for being the blandest - especially the shockingly wooden Cameli, and the whole thing recycles itself to the point where I was quickly on the side of the perpetrator of these dastardly goings-on. What’s more annoying is that the plot did have some potential; it could have been better had the director relied less on the tried and tested formulae and taken a few risks with the story.

What makes this even worse than the usual formulaic, survivalist, horror nonsense, is its story is based upon a time loop. So, in essence, this is a horror flick, with obsessive compulsive disorder. The murder and mayhem repeats itself, stripping away even the basic sense of the unknown, as we stop wondering and worrying over, who is going to die and when. 

I can see how this would work in the context of a video game, which this film, is based upon. In games players die over and over, until they finally find a way to beat the game. As a film, its not a great idea, at all. A sense of lethargy and boredom sets in, as everyone dies over and over again. 

Without sounding too negative, there is a limited upside. The atmosphere of dread is well established, creature effects are reasonable, as is acting, from the cast. The deaths are varied too, so its not wholly a case of deja vu. 

In summary, a basic watch that breaks the first rule of survivalist  horror, with everyone dying, repeatedly. In turn, the sense of urgency and threat is dissipated, leading to a somewhat tedious, fundamentally repetitive, watch.",dawn call scoobie adults group pals vacation romp find facing mysterious back story lots supernatural baddies croak bloody style makes even worse usual formulaic survivalist horror nonsense story based upon time loop essence horror flick obsessive compulsive disorder murder mayhem repeats stripping away even basic sense unknown stop wondering worrying going die see would work context video game film based upon games players die finally find way beat game film great idea sense lethargy boredom sets everyone dies without sounding negative limited upside atmosphere dread well established creature effects reasonable acting cast deaths varied wholly case deja vu summary basic watch breaks first rule survivalist horror everyone dying repeatedly turn sense urgency threat dissipated leading somewhat tedious fundamentally repetitive watch,Positive

The Godfather,Drama,"The Godfather Review by Al Carlson

The Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.
The Godfather revolves around the Corleone’s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone’s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn’t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo’s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo’s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.
The characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don’s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It’s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.
Directer Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola’s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. 
This film should be immediately followed up by it’s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They’re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won’t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven’t seen this movie yet, it’s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can’t refuse.",godfather review al carlson godfather film considered one greatest ever made american film institute voted users internet movie database imdb consider one best film ranks high masterpieces including citizen kane pulp fiction angry men godfather exceptional piece cinema excellence flawless simply pinnacle crime drama godfather revolves around corleone italian family deep roots new york city mafia head corleone vito corleone man takes care family demands respect return son michael however returned home world war ii want become involved family business sollozzo family drug dealers confront request protection exchange profits sollozzo drug sales declines offer selling narcotics rejected offer starts turns mafia war two families michael diving deep mafia lifestyle characters portrayed legendary star cast including marlon brando al pacino son michael james caan oldest son sonny casting film considered many best casted film history astonishing performances three main actors nominated academy award marlon brando oscar best actor leading role fascinating watch characters change course movie one particular changing drastically directer francis ford coppola raised italian american family new york understood italian culture exceptionally made film authentically everything wedding dances cuisine terms used characters sicilian come coppola first hand knowledge italian american culture italian composer nino rota outstanding job making soundtrack film despite getting oscar best music win oscar work sequel godfather part ii virtually everyone recognizes iconic trumpet solo starts playing also wrote score another great italian film film immediately followed sequel godfather part ii also best picture series still holds title best picture awards film series day flawless crime dramas earned titles best pieces cinema ever guarantee able see film gets better continual viewings really nothing add seen movie yet time godfather movie refuse,Negative

The Godfather,Drama,"While I'm writing this, The Godfather is still beloved by people who love it simply because they are told they have to love it. 
It's written by a mobster with the sole intention of depicting the lead mobsters as demi gods. Every line and every scene in the movie and the book is meant to intimidate people into thinking the ""Mafia"" and really any mob, is a supernatural force.
This is a movie glorifying control freaks, and most critics are control freaks, and most critics are either in the mob or think they can join the mob.
The movie itself is dull and totally uninspiring, not to mention totally uninspired. For fifty years, the sheep have been cowing to the control freaks who tell them to love this movie that degrades them. 
There just isn't anything favorable about this movie. It owes its success to people who have interests in the movie or think they can get brownie points with such people.

The Godfather,Drama,"When you get a story written quite this magnificently it would take an extreme amateur to screw it up - and Francis Ford Coppola is no amateur. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall represent the epitome of guile, sophistication, loyalty, honour and brutality in this self-adapted Mario Puzo story of the unambiguously ambitious ""Corleone"" family - they start with nothing and so the only way is up; however and whatever they need to do to get there. The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother ""Fredo"" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made. My only criticism, and it is slight at that, is that the audio mix could have done with a bit of a boost. Much of the dialogue - especially from Brando - verges on the inaudible at times.",get story written quite magnificently would take extreme amateur screw francis ford coppola amateur marlon brando al pacino james caan robert duvall represent epitome guile sophistication loyalty honour brutality self adapted mario puzo story unambiguously ambitious corleone family start nothing way however whatever need get characterisations layered colourful diane keaton idea getting john cazale great spineless brother fredo nino rota pulls stops give score helps cement film place amongst best ever made criticism slight audio mix could done bit boost much dialogue especially brando verges inaudible times,Negative
The Godfather,Drama,Great Movie **Ever**,great movie ever,Positive
The Godfather,Drama,"The Godfather (1972), directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece that redefined storytelling in film. Based on Mario Puzo’s bestselling novel, the movie seamlessly blends crime drama with an epic exploration of power, loyalty, and family. Every frame is a testament to Coppola’s brilliance, as he transforms a gripping tale into a timeless work of art.

At the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando’s unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles.

Coppola’s direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the “Prince of Darkness,” enhances the film’s iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota’s haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend.

A fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history.

The Godfather isn’t just a movie—it’s an experience. It’s a study of power and morality, a family saga, and a crime thriller all rolled into one. Its influence on filmmaking is immeasurable, and its performances, direction, and storytelling remain unparalleled. This is a film that stands the test of time, and for good reason: it’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",godfather directed legendary francis ford coppola nothing short cinematic masterpiece redefined storytelling film based mario puzo bestselling novel movie seamlessly blends crime drama epic exploration power loyalty family every frame testament coppola brilliance transforms gripping tale timeless work art center monumental film marlon brando unforgettable performance vito corleone brando masterfully embodies aging patriarch aura quiet menace profound wisdom earning well deserved academy award best actor al pacino delivers career defining performance michael corleone evolving reluctant outsider ruthless leader chilling yet utterly believable transformation james caan fiery sonny corleone robert duvall cool headed consigliere tom hagen also shine adding complexity depth roles coppola direction nothing short visionary ability craft intricate narrative maintaining deliberate pace allows characters themes breathe cinematography gordon willis often referred prince darkness enhances film iconic look using shadows warm tones convey sense intimacy foreboding nino rota haunting score particularly famous godfather waltz elevates film legend fun fact studio initially resisted casting marlon brando considered difficult work time coppola fight famously convinced studio showing test reel brando stuffing cheeks cotton balls transform iconic vito corleone rest say history godfather movie experience study power morality family saga crime thriller rolled one influence filmmaking immeasurable performances direction storytelling remain unparalleled film stands test time good reason masterpiece every sense word,Positive

The Dark Knight,Drama,"This has no competition. It is the very finest comic-book character movie ever made. Knowing the Burton, Donner and Nolan filmic adaptations of Batman and Superman exist helps me to sleep at night. They are Exhibit A of 'How to Make a Comic-Book Movie'. Nothing else has ever come even remotely close. These seven films (I include 'Superman II' because it was mostly Donner's work)--and Nolan's trilogy especially--are what I imagine a great director like Kubrick, Hitchcock or Kurosawa would have come up with, if they had ever been asked to make a Superman or Batman movie. They are the easiest for an audience to identify with because in these the scripts most approximate human emotions and the typical conundrums of the human experience--in short, are the closest, in a good way, they come to the complexities of the human condition.

The Dark Knight,Drama,"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.

The Dark Knight,Drama,"One of the best movies of all time. Christopher Nolan has brought us the Batman trilogy that it made it feel it could happen today. Christian Bale returns as Batman, was able to perform as wonderfully as he did in Batman Begins. The one person that ultimately stole the show had to be the late Heath Ledger who played as the Joker. His performance as a psychotic clown terrorizing Gotham City was one of the best performance as a superhero villain. One of the best parts of the Joker was when he was telling his victims on how “he got his scars?”. Another great part was when he kidnapped a police officer and he was recording it while scaring the man and also giving a warning to Batman. The supporting actor and actresses did a good job of delivering the story. I was disappointed that Katie Holmes did not return as Rachael Dawes but the actress how played as her Maggie Gyllenhaal did a really good job.

Nolan clearly did not intend for any subtext, yet that is not an excuse, if anything, that makes it worse. He includes these scenes to make the film more dark and edgy, yet there are people, from suppressed countries, who have to live through the hardships of violence from law-enforcers and dictatorship every day, and in his obliviousness, Nolan thinks that using this in a superhero film is a good excuse for self-importance.

The Dark Knight,Drama,"Heath Ledger is outstanding in this follow up to the 2006 ""Batman Begins"" outing for the caped crusader. His portrayal of the malevolent ""Joker' is confident and highly entertaining, treading a fine line between supreme intellect and total insanity with considerable aplomb. He comes back to terrorise ""Gotham"" after ""Batman"" (Christian Bale), ""Gordon"" (Gary Oldman) - now Commissioner in charge of the police force, and newly installed District Attorney ""Dent"" (Aaron Eckhart) had made progress getting the criminals off the street. The ""Joker"", meantime, decides that the best strategy is to rob the mob - and pitching them all against each other, and with the help of the duplicitous ""Lau"" (Chin Han) manages to secure enough of their funds to initiate a campaign of lawlessness that is ruthless, manipulative and good fun to watch. Not only has the man in black his new, potent, nemesis to deal with - but he also begins to realise that his childhood sweetheart ""Rachel"" (this time Maggie Gyllenhaal) is drifting into the arms of the new DA. it is also pretty clear that they are both now proving to be an useful additional weapon in the armoury of his enemy who knows, increasingly, which buttons to press to cause maximum anxiety among those who would bring him down. It's over 2½ hours long, but really does fly by as the quickly paced action really does kick in right from the start. The story is dark and gritty but the pace isn't ponderous and moody - Ledger exudes a sense of peril throughout the whole thing, but that has an edge to it - a sophistication that plays well against the flawed superhero who is increasingly having to identify and cope with his own demons. Sir Michael Caine pops up now and again as his shrewd butler ""Alfred"", always striving to keep his boss on the right side of sanity, and Morgan Freeman continues to feature (sparingly) and his quartermaster. On that latter front, there are loads of new gadgets that still have that element of plausibility to them (no super-powers!). On balance I think I still preferred the first film, but as sequels go - this takes, and will take, some beating.

An epic scale with magnificent action pieces, oscar-winning performances, incredible writing, excellent pacing, dazzling special effects, and the list goes on and on, including the set design, costumes, and more. But, Christopher Nolan did more than make the greatest superhero movie of all time. He made one of the greatest movies of all time!

The Dark Knight,Drama,"Even worse than Tim Burton's Batman, although obviously copying the neo Nazi ideology of ""kill all the brunettes you can in a movie"".
This is so predictable and so poorly written that it boggles the mind. Yet there is a fan base of what can only be described as neo Nazis. I guess those fans were poor cuckolds who got jilted by too many brunettes at a young age, and they couldn't get over it.
That's about the entire story here. Oh, the Joker kills anything he sees. Whoopee. And he's invulnerable. And he's a demigod who can only be beaten by another demigod.
So, we've got traditional mundane Greek heroes and villains here, just like most Hollywood movies.
Unfortunately, the fans of these traditional Hollywood movies are the loudest people on Earth, and the biggest control freaks. It's ridiculous to believe there are actually this big a percentage of fans for this kind of depressing Hollywood formula movie making, but if you look at Imdb's top 250, you see such movies make up over half of the top 250. Are they voted up because control freaks vote more than non control freaks? Or are they voted up because control freaks use many fake user names? Probably both, which explains why over half of the top 250 are nothing more than Greek traditional idolizations of control freaks.
Oh, and Batman turns totally gay, which would be okay if he'd admit it, but he's given the choice of saving a man from death or a hot woman from death, and he chooses to save the man. This isn't any real Batman. It's just another contrived story line for the Nolan Nazi merit badge. They are not even subtle. They bang you over the head with their worship of Adolf and Eva. 
God help the world if this garbage still has a fan base fifty years from now. But it could happen. We may have drug addicts and meth heads around for even longer than that, praising the hate and feeding the hate. It would be nice if someone made a real Batman movie with a real story line involving some degree of motivation.",even worse tim burton batman although obviously copying neo nazi ideology kill brunettes movie predictable poorly written boggles mind yet fan base described neo nazis guess fans poor cuckolds got jilted many brunettes young age get entire story oh joker kills anything sees whoopee invulnerable demigod beaten another demigod got traditional mundane greek heroes villains like hollywood movies unfortunately fans traditional hollywood movies loudest people earth biggest control freaks ridiculous believe actually big percentage fans kind depressing hollywood formula movie making look imdb top see movies make half top voted control freaks vote non control freaks voted control freaks use many fake user names probably explains half top nothing greek traditional idolizations control freaks oh batman turns totally gay would okay admit given choice saving man death hot woman death chooses save man real batman another contrived story line nolan nazi merit badge even subtle bang head worship adolf eva god help world garbage still fan base fifty years could happen may drug addicts meth heads around even longer praising hate feeding hate would nice someone made real batman movie real story line involving degree motivation,Positive

The Dark Knight,Drama,"The Dark Knight (2008), directed by Christopher Nolan, isn’t just another superhero film—it’s a gripping piece of cinema that balances action, emotion, and a deep exploration of morality and chaos. It’s the kind of movie that lingers with you, not because of its spectacle, but because of the questions it asks and the unforgettable performances it delivers. Chief among those is Heath Ledger’s Joker, a portrayal that reshaped how we see villains.

Ledger’s performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary. He’s chaotic and unpredictable, yet his presence is magnetic—every moment he’s on screen feels alive with tension. From his unsettling voice to his haunting laugh, he created a character that’s terrifyingly human yet larger than life. Ledger didn’t just act the part; he became the Joker, and it’s a performance that still sends chills down your spine. It’s no wonder he was awarded a posthumous Oscar—this wasn’t just a role; it was a transformation.

Christian Bale continues to bring depth to Bruce Wayne, exploring his inner conflict and the weight of his decisions as Gotham’s protector. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent adds a tragic layer to the story, showing how even the noblest intentions can be corrupted. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman bring warmth and stability to a world teetering on the edge of chaos.

What really sets The Dark Knight apart, though, is Nolan’s storytelling. He doesn’t just focus on action—though the film has some of the most intense sequences you’ll see—but on creating a story that makes you think. The way it explores the fragile balance between order and chaos, the cost of heroism, and the power of fear, makes it a deeply compelling watch. Add to that the breathtaking visuals and Hans Zimmer’s score, which pulses with urgency, and you’ve got a film that’s as thrilling as it is thought-provoking.

Here’s a fun tidbit: Ledger’s iconic scene where he claps in the jail cell was entirely unscripted. It’s one of those moments that perfectly captures the Joker’s unsettling genius, and it’s all thanks to Ledger’s improvisation.

The Dark Knight is a film that deserves all the praise it gets. It’s intense, thoughtful, and unforgettable, with Heath Ledger delivering one of the most iconic performances of all time. If you haven’t seen it yet—or even if you have—it’s a movie that’s always worth revisiting.",dark knight directed christopher nolan another superhero film gripping piece cinema balances action emotion deep exploration morality chaos kind movie lingers spectacle questions asks unforgettable performances delivers chief among heath ledger joker portrayal reshaped see villains ledger performance joker nothing short extraordinary chaotic unpredictable yet presence magnetic every moment screen feels alive tension unsettling voice haunting laugh created character terrifyingly human yet larger life ledger act part became joker performance still sends chills spine wonder awarded posthumous oscar role transformation christian bale continues bring depth bruce wayne exploring inner conflict weight decisions gotham protector aaron eckhart harvey dent adds tragic layer story showing even noblest intentions corrupted gary oldman michael caine morgan freeman bring warmth stability world teetering edge chaos really sets dark knight apart though nolan storytelling focus action though film intense sequences see creating story makes think way explores fragile balance order chaos cost heroism power fear makes deeply compelling watch add breathtaking visuals hans zimmer score pulses urgency got film thrilling thought provoking fun tidbit ledger iconic scene claps jail cell entirely unscripted one moments perfectly captures joker unsettling genius thanks ledger improvisation dark knight film deserves praise gets intense thoughtful unforgettable heath ledger delivering one iconic performances time seen yet even movie always worth revisiting,Negative
Materialists,Romance,"Definitely not a Rom-Com. (And that's a good thing.)

-

Some false advertising with this one. 

There's romance, yes. There are a few laughs, yes. This, however, is not a romantic comedy.

What it is is a two-hour philosophical journey on the themes of self-worth, value, and materialism through the lens of three very flawed characters. 

As a cynic, I appreciated that. With such beautiful principal actors it would be very easy to gin up a 90's or 00's type of rom-com, but this was exceedingly more thoughtful and interesting. 

If I have any complaint at all, it's the ending, which (IMHO) did not fit with the overall theme of the story and a little forced.

Materialists,Romance,"Celine Song's Materialists is a stunningly mature, emotionally intelligent romantic drama, one that redefines the very concept of modern love without falling into the usual pitfalls of the genre. Anchored by three outstanding performances, Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal share extraordinary chemistry that feels raw, layered, and heartbreakingly authentic. Song's screenplay dissects with surgical precision the transactional nature of today's dating world, where intangible values like affection and vulnerability often struggle against the ever-growing checklist of material, social, and political boxes. Money, body image, height, political leanings - even something as seemingly trivial as the texture of one's hair - are thoughtfully explored as factors that, in theory, should dictate compatibility. But through intimate silences, aching glances, and conversations that pierce right through the soul, Song reminds us that love, in all its flawed, inexplicable glory, cannot be quantified.

Technically, Materialists is a masterclass in restraint. There's barely a musical score to be found, allowing every silence, every breath, and every hesitant word to carry the full weight of the characters' feelings. The cinematography makes the bold, unconventional choice to focus on the listener rather than the speaker, granting the audience rare insight into the unsaid, the reactions that words alone can't convey. Lingering shots in moments of silence exude not only tension but a rare, electric chemistry between the characters. The film crafts its emotional crescendo without a single moment of forced dramatization, making the eventual choices of Johnson's character feel entirely organic. Song bravely avoids providing easy answers: there's no judgment, no clear winner in the love triangle. Whether one follows love with all its imperfections, as in the Dakota-Evans connection, or chooses the materially perfect partner lacking in emotional spark, as represented by Pascal's character, Materialists argues that either path is valid - and equally human.

If there's one area where Song perhaps leans too heavily, it's in the recurring client interviews of Johnson's character, which, while often sharp and humorous, begin to border on repetitive. The thematic point about society's shallow dating expectations lands early on, and a couple of these scenes feel like they're spelling out what the rest of the movie has already conveyed so gracefully. But this minor excess does little to detract from the overall impact. Materialists stands as one of the finest romantic dramas in recent memory, brilliantly avoiding the traps of cliché and formula. It's a profoundly insightful exploration of why we fall in love, and how that choice - no matter how irrational, imperfect, or impractical - might be the truest thing about us.

My Fault,Romance,"Someone must have got fed up with the constant slating of the ""After..."" series and thought - ""I know, let's make something that will really make those films look good"".

""Noah"" (Nicole Wallace) has had to relocate to live with her mother and her new husband in a palatial home that also happens to be occupied by her rather weedy step-brother ""Nick"" (Gabriel Guevara). Now the two do not hit it off. He's a bit of a cocky git and she's equally no-nonsense about things - so that ought to be the end. Rock and hard place kind of thing. Nope, no such luck. For almost two hours this takes us on the most predictable of romantic dramas that actually manages to incorporate car chases, fist fighting, sex, familial drama, more (beach) sex and a kidnapping. I would say you couldn't make it up, but clearly the series-prone author Mercedes Ron did in her novel. Amazon have early thrown some cash at this, but little of it was spent on the screenplay and the acting - well Wallace reminded me a little of Shailene Woodley but ""Nick"" is just an overblown drip - with or without his clothes.

The Gorge,Romance,"The Gorge (2025) is a movie that gets a lot of things right, blending action, romance, and a bit of suspense into a well-paced story. The plot is simple yet clever, unfolding naturally without unnecessary complexity. It keeps things engaging with steady character development, making you feel connected to the leads as their situation evolves. While some critics seem to take the romance out of context, it actually makes perfect sense within the story. It’s not just there for the sake of it but develops realistically based on their circumstances. Sure, there are some plot holes, but unless you're watching just to nitpick, they don’t take away from the experience.

Visually, the movie stands out with dramatic lighting and smart camera work that keeps you immersed. Even daytime scenes carry a certain mood that adds to the film’s atmosphere. The cinematography is well thought out, with the right angles capturing the emotional depth of the characters while also making the action sequences hit hard. Speaking of action, while there’s plenty of it, the movie does lean more into its emotional core rather than being a full-on action spectacle. The CGI is solid, blending in naturally without feeling overdone, and while some moments might remind you of other films, it never feels like a cheap copy.

The performances are strong, with both leads carrying the entire movie effortlessly. Their chemistry feels real, and their dialogue doesn’t come off as forced or unnatural. The script is well executed, moving the story forward at the right pace without dragging things out. The music and sound design complement the film nicely, enhancing key moments without overpowering them. Overall, The Gorge has a high rewatch factor, the kind of movie you'd want to show a friend just to experience it again.

The Gorge,Romance,"The Gorge (2025), directed by Scott Derrickson, is a unique mix of action, horror, and romance. Starring Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy, the film follows two elite snipers assigned to guard a mysterious chasm hiding dark secrets.

While the film delivers thrilling action and strong performances, some critics feel the romance subplot falls flat. The pacing is uneven, with a slow setup and a rushed climax. However, the genre-blending and chemistry between the leads make it an entertaining watch.

The Gorge,Romance,"The Gorge works, in spite of some conspicuous short comings.

Lets get the negatives out of the way. An absurdly illogical story, filled with characters who do improbable, often stupid things. A lack of clear direction in terms of what the story is supposed to be, a love story, an action thriller, a horror, fantasy, sci fi tale?

Oddly, I would argue its the creative cocktail of discordant genres and elements, that actually helps this film succeed. Firstly, ""The Gorge"" works wonderfully as a romance. The chemistry between the key characters sparkles with humour, quirkiness and passion. It functions too, as a fantasy horror, sci fi, thriller with highly creative story and action aspects, that come together beautifully. CGI is only okay but it operates well enough, to make things creepily exciting. 

In summary, I enjoyed this film. Its compelling, exciting, likeable and inherently watchable, in spite of its often glaring shortcomings.

365 Days: This Day,Romance,"Undoubtedly still awful viewing, but... I found it a tiny bit more watchable than its predecessor.

<em>'365 Days: This Day'</em> still has nothing that even closely resembles a plot, still has extremely limited actors and still shouldn't even exist. However, I'd be lying if I said I disliked it as much as the 2020 original. It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!

Unlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else!  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

There's even some minor neat cinematography, too. The positives I note are minimal, though, and don't overly help this 2022 production. I have more negatives, which also include an overlong run time and that shoddy ending. At least it marginally improves upon the film it follows, I wonder if its own sequel will do likewise?

Oh, that's beautiful: two people (?) sitting in the sunset, both beautiful, the guy has a tattoo on his palm, nowhere else (Redflag!!), she stares deeply in love at his quivering lips. The male lead looks as if the coke delivery from the wholesaler hasn't arrived, she's naked again. And then, wow, that look - like someone fell asleep on Instagram's sepia filter slider. Everything looks so beautifully even.

In addition, the lovely sounds of the best that the German charts have to offer jingle from positions 58 to 72. Is it always the same song? Or lots of them that always sound the same? Is it even music or has someone kicked the neighbor's cat in the shin again? I don't know it. But no time to think. One of the mega hot soft sex games is just beginning, which is always really nasty and unpleasant.

It's sooo romantic. She says “Fuck me”, he says nothing as usual, but his look has now changed from a coke hit to a stroke. And then he licks it. Oh, great. With the whole tongue, once across the face and the adjacent table leg. Luckily, the endless banter is filmed in super slow motion, so the torture...cinematic ecstasy lasts much, much longer.

Suddenly he says... no, that's not true, he doesn't say anything. We only speak here in emergencies. Even if there's probably some kind of mafia plot being told, which I overlooked in all the constant fucking around. Unfortunately, I didn't understand who all these people were until the end. Well, of course it's stupid that I didn't see the first part, but it's also a little bit unusual that this sequel doesn't make any effort to give these characters any depth. Or to explain what is actually going on here. Is anything even going on? Well, it doesn't matter. The guys are supposed to be cute and the women are supposed to be persistent and stupid. And oh - they start slobbering on each other again 😍😍😍

365 Days: This Day,Romance,"If I were in the mood to watch adult content, Netflix would definitely not be my first choice. The movie I stumbled upon was a total disaster, making me extremely uncomfortable, especially when children unexpectedly walked into the room. It was a messy experience that I strongly advise against.

The sequel follows the same pattern, and both films are filled with excessive plot holes, acting issues, and seem to lack a meaningful storyline. It feels like they are veering towards the wrong direction, almost resembling pornography rather than a film with substance.

Anora,Romance,"We’re all familiar with the old adage that, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. It’s a notion that applies not only to what can happen in everyday life, but also to what shows up on the big screen, as the latest feature from writer-director Sean Baker illustrates. This widely acclaimed indie offering follows the misadventures of a Brooklyn lap dancer/sex worker (Mikey Madison) who falls for the insanely rich, self-absorbed, wildly irresponsible son of a Russian oligarch (Mark Eydelshteyn). Together they take the plunge into an edgy, wacked-out fairy tale, a dark storybook romance strung out on steroids, quaaludes and crack. Their whirlwind affair soon lands them in Las Vegas, culminating in a green card wedding that junior’s mobster parents (Darya Ekamasova, Aleksey Serebryakov) want annulled at any cost, even if it means calling on their oily, bumbling posse of cronies and heavies (Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan, Yura Borisov) to lean on the alleged lovebirds. But achieving that goal ultimately proves more difficult than imagined. As a cross-country chase ensues, a string of frenzied events leaves mom, dad and friends infuriated and the Gothamite Cinderella disillusioned, having erroneously thought she’d truly hit the jackpot this time. From this, one might easily think this premise has a solid foundation for an outrageous, uproarious comedy, but, sadly, the film lives up to its potential only some of the time. To be sure, there is some genuinely hysterical, wonderfully inventive material here, but it only hits the mark about half the time. What’s more, much of the story (especially in the film’s first half) is predictable, almost clichéd, with some bits dragging on needlessly long. Indeed, I’m somewhat mystified as to what all the critical fuss is about, something perhaps best evidenced by the picture’s capture of the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the event’s highest honor. I readily admit to being a fan of Baker’s work, having immensely enjoyed his previous efforts “Red Rocket” (2021), “The Florida Project” (2017) and “Tangerine” (2015). But I’m genuinely at a loss to understand the level of praise that’s been lavished on this release. It’s a capable film in a number of respects, but the filmmaker clearly has done better, and those prior offerings make better viewing options in my opinion. Don’t fall for all the hype here, as this really is one of those cases of something being too good to be true.",familiar old adage something seems good true probably notion applies happen everyday life also shows big screen latest feature writer director sean baker illustrates widely acclaimed indie offering follows misadventures brooklyn lap dancer sex worker mikey madison falls insanely rich self absorbed wildly irresponsible son russian oligarch mark eydelshteyn together take plunge edgy wacked fairy tale dark storybook romance strung steroids quaaludes crack whirlwind affair soon lands las vegas culminating green card wedding junior mobster parents darya ekamasova aleksey serebryakov want annulled cost even means calling oily bumbling posse cronies heavies karren karagulian vache tovmasyan yura borisov lean alleged lovebirds achieving goal ultimately proves difficult imagined cross country chase ensues string frenzied events leaves mom dad friends infuriated gothamite cinderella disillusioned erroneously thought truly hit jackpot time one might easily think premise solid foundation outrageous uproarious comedy sadly film lives potential time sure genuinely hysterical wonderfully inventive material hits mark half time much story especially film first half predictable almost clich bits dragging needlessly long indeed somewhat mystified critical fuss something perhaps best evidenced picture capture palme year cannes film festival event highest honor readily admit fan baker work immensely enjoyed previous efforts red rocket florida project tangerine genuinely loss understand level praise lavished release capable film number respects filmmaker clearly done better prior offerings make better viewing options opinion fall hype really one cases something good true,Negative

She actually quite likes his youthful exuberance - and his cash - and after a few days, a Russian sable coat, and a trip to Vegas, they find themselves marred.

He duly sends his two enforcers to the house where all hell promptly breaks loose. ""Garnick"" (Vache Tovmasyan) and ""Tom"" (Anton Bitter) are merely to detain the pair until their boss arrives to insist that marriage is going to be annulled; ""Ani"" is having none of that and ""Vanya"" - well he's just a little bit conflicted and quickly things start to go pear-shaped! This film starts off strongly with an entertaining courtship scenario played out between two actors who really do look like they are enjoying themselves.

""Vanya"" doesn't feature so much and the story becomes a little less engaging as the rather too gentle thugs and the increasingly irate girl try to get everyone to the courthouse for the ruling before his angry mother arrives. That leaves us with too much overacting from Karagulian and some increasingly implausible scenarios as the air is gradually let out of the thing and it comes to end rather disappointingly.

Anora,Romance,"Anora is a film that starts off strong, pulling you in with an intriguing setup and a well-paced first act. It follows a story that keeps you invested, blending drama with some unexpected humor. The second act stretches a bit longer than needed, but it's clear that was intentional to build atmosphere and let certain themes play out. While the pacing is deliberate, it sometimes feels like it's lingering in places that don't add much depth to the characters. That being said, the buildup is engaging, even if the payoff leaves something to be desired.

Sean Baker's directing is solid, capturing a raw, almost documentary-like feel that makes the film feel real and immersive. He knows how to make everyday settings feel alive and uses long takes effectively. The cinematography complements this, keeping things grounded with natural lighting and handheld shots that add an almost voyeuristic feel to the story. It’s visually well-crafted, even if it doesn’t aim for anything particularly stylized. The way the camera lingers on certain moments adds weight to the film's themes, even when the script doesn’t fully explore them.

Mikey Madison delivers a standout performance, carrying much of the film. She brings a layered energy to the role, making her character feel both confident and vulnerable when needed. The supporting cast does their job well, but the script doesn't give them much depth to work with. That’s one of the film’s weaknesses, while it sets up an interesting premise and characters, it doesn’t fully flesh them out. You get a sense of their motivations, but not much beyond that. The dialogue is sharp in some moments but feels underdeveloped in others, leaving certain interactions feeling a bit hollow.

The score and sound design are subtle, used more for atmosphere than standout moments. The film relies heavily on natural sounds and ambient noise, which works well for its grounded approach. It enhances the realism but doesn't do much to elevate the emotions of the film. 

Overall, Anora is a well-directed and well-acted film that keeps you engaged, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing. If you’re looking for a character-driven story with a raw, unfiltered feel, it’s worth a watch, but don’t expect a big payoff in the end.",anora film starts strong pulling intriguing setup well paced first act follows story keeps invested blending drama unexpected humor second act stretches bit longer needed clear intentional build atmosphere let certain themes play pacing deliberate sometimes feels like lingering places add much depth characters said buildup engaging even payoff leaves something desired sean baker directing solid capturing raw almost documentary like feel makes film feel real immersive knows make everyday settings feel alive uses long takes effectively cinematography complements keeping things grounded natural lighting handheld shots add almost voyeuristic feel story visually well crafted even aim anything particularly stylized way camera lingers certain moments adds weight film themes even script fully explore mikey madison delivers standout performance carrying much film brings layered energy role making character feel confident vulnerable needed supporting cast job well script give much depth work one film weaknesses sets interesting premise characters fully flesh get sense motivations much beyond dialogue sharp moments feels underdeveloped others leaving certain interactions feeling bit hollow score sound design subtle used atmosphere standout moments film relies heavily natural sounds ambient noise works well grounded approach enhances realism much elevate emotions film overall anora well directed well acted film keeps engaged quite stick landing looking character driven story raw unfiltered feel worth watch expect big payoff end,Negative
Anora,Romance,"<em>'Anora'</em> is an absolute cracker! The film is unadulterated chaos, I honestly needed the silentness of it ending so I could relax. As usual, I'm not one to judge it on its deep-rooted meaning or whatever, I'll leave that to others, all I can say is that it's a blast and I unequivocally loved it.

Mikey Madison's performance is sensational, quite the showing indeed! Apparently I've seen her in three other things (much less prominent roles, admittedly) before, evidently I don't remember her from those - but safe to say, I won't be forgetting Madison from this at any point. Superb!

Away from the star performer, Mark Eydelshteyn makes the most out of his role. The trio of Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan and Yura Borisov are great comedic support. I've seen Aleksei Serebryakov here and there down the years and he always plays the same roles, I like him though.

The 139 minutes go by in a flash, with the utterly chaotic nature it is no surprise. It isn't the most difficult movie to predict given that you are waiting for the crap to hit the fan, but how it gets to that point is a wild ride to witness - the concluding scene is stand out, too.

I still have three more of the nominees to watch, but this overtakes <em>'The Substance'</em> as the film that would hypothetically get my vote for Best Picture; not that I take much value from that (or any other) awards ceremony.

Anora,Romance,"Despite a very rough start, “Anora” ultimately offers a unique and entertaining exploration of the humanity behind sex work and the complexities of love, pain, and trauma. I was so close to giving up on the film during its excruciating opening thirty minutes, which I found dull, grating, and gratuitous. The early part of the movie is laden with an unnecessary and gratuitous parade of explicit scenes and a focus on unlikable characters doing uninteresting things. Now I am thankful that I didn’t storm out of the theater, because the eventual payoff is more than worth the investment.

As I reflect on the film, I’ve come to the realization that the style and tone of the film’s opening half hour might be more intentional than I first thought. Writer and director Sean Baker, known for his ability to capture the lives of marginalized people with empathy and complexity in his previous works “The Florida Project” and “Tangerine,” appears to be making a deliberate statement. The first act, with its emphasis on the superficial, transactional view of sex work, feels almost intentionally alienating, highlighting how society often reduces sex workers to mere objects of desire that exist solely to be used, abused, and discarded. It’s designed to make viewers uncomfortable, mostly because it seems to be a critique of how these people are seen as less than human. Sex workers like Anora are often dismissed as disposable rather than as individuals with depth and feelings.

Once the film transitions into the second act, it gains momentum and its true heartbeat emerges. The focus shifts to Anora (Mikey Madison), a young sex worker from Brooklyn who impulsively marries a powerful Russian oligarch’s playboy son, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn). As news of the marriage reaches Russia, it threatens to derail her new life. Ivan’s parents are infuriated and head to New York to have the union annulled. The plot sounds like a simple and goofy romantic comedy, but it becomes more layered as the film progresses.

Baker excels in depicting characters on the fringes of society, and Anora is no exception. She’s flawed, complicated, and completely human in her desire to be happy, safe, and loved. As we get to know the character better, her strength, resilience, and vulnerability shines through. It’s a real testament to how much Baker understands his characters and the environments they inhabit. They are never caricatures but relatable, normal people caught up in difficult, often tragic circumstances. And this, I think, is where the film really succeeds.

It’s a serious story that takes an unexpected turn when a trio of bumbling criminal characters show up, adding some much-needed levity and energy to the film. The comedic angle is strange but also highly entertaining, which provides a nice contrast to the tension-filled dramatic elements. The humor balances the more serious undertones of the story and injects an unexpected freshness into the film, making it easier (and a lot more fun) to invest in Anora’s journey.

What’s really going to have audiences talking is the ending, and it’s the place where the film leaves its most notable mark. I can imagine the final frame will be analyzed and discussed and misunderstood, but it’s one of the most profound, heartbreaking, and touching conclusions I’ve seen this year.

WARNING: I am issuing a spoiler alert for the next paragraph. Please stop reading now if you’ve not yet seen the film.

When Igor (Yura Borisov) and Anora are together in the final act, this isn’t a typical “rescue” or “knight in shining armor” trope that you’d expect to find in a romantic film. Their sad and painful attempt at intimacy is a deeply meaningful and emotional recognition between two people who have been hurt by the world in similar ways. It’s a poignant reminder that love and healing often come from shared experiences of pain, and that empathy can transcend even the most complicated circumstances. It’s just so heartbreaking and sad, and I’m not sure there’s another film that’s so accurately or sensitively conveyed a person’s haunting emotional wounds with such authenticity.

It goes without saying that despite a miserable opening, “Anora” ultimately won me over. This is a flawed but compelling story about a woman reclaiming her agency, confronting the societal labels placed on her, and finding something profoundly human in a world that seeks to strip her of it.

Anora,Romance,"Sean Baker's Oscar-winning ""Anora"" presents a peculiar paradox of contemporary cinema: a film celebrated for its supposed boundary-pushing that ultimately offers little beyond its taboo subject matter. At 139 minutes, Baker's tale of a sex worker who briefly marries into Russian wealth before facing brutal rejection stretches a thin premise far beyond its natural breaking point.

Mikey Madison delivers a performance of remarkable depth, finding nuanced humanity in a character that the screenplay itself seems uninterested in fully exploring. Her work transcends the material, suggesting emotional complexities the script merely gestures at. Madison deserves every accolade for creating a compelling person where the screenplay offers only a situation.

The film's moments of genuine comedy provide welcome relief but highlight the fundamental problem: ""Anora"" mistakes setting (sex work) for substance. When compared to Jean-Luc Godard's ""Vivre sa Vie,"" which used prostitution as a lens to examine profound questions of autonomy, capitalism, and gender, Baker's film feels superficial. Godard achieved more philosophical depth in 83 minutes than Baker manages in over two hours.

Contemporary cinema increasingly confuses progressive subject matter with progressive thinking. Merely depicting marginalized experiences without offering fresh insight or formal innovation becomes a hollow exercise. One cannot help but wonder whether ""Anora"" received accolades for what it attempted to say rather than what it actually achieved.

The central narrative - a woman from difficult circumstances discovering she can be loved for herself - is neither original nor developed with particular insight. What might have been a focused, powerful short film instead becomes a meandering feature that suggests profundity without delivering it.

Baker's technical competence is evident, but technical skill alone cannot disguise the absence of a compelling artistic vision.

Anora,Romance,"We’re all familiar with the old adage that, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. It’s a notion that applies not only to what can happen in everyday life, but also to what shows up on the big screen, as the latest feature from writer-director Sean Baker illustrates. This widely acclaimed indie offering follows the misadventures of a Brooklyn lap dancer/sex worker (Mikey Madison) who falls for the insanely rich, self-absorbed, wildly irresponsible son of a Russian oligarch (Mark Eydelshteyn). Together they take the plunge into an edgy, wacked-out fairy tale, a dark storybook romance strung out on steroids, quaaludes and crack. Their whirlwind affair soon lands them in Las Vegas, culminating in a green card wedding that junior’s mobster parents (Darya Ekamasova, Aleksey Serebryakov) want annulled at any cost, even if it means calling on their oily, bumbling posse of cronies and heavies (Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan, Yura Borisov) to lean on the alleged lovebirds. But achieving that goal ultimately proves more difficult than imagined. As a cross-country chase ensues, a string of frenzied events leaves mom, dad and friends infuriated and the Gothamite Cinderella disillusioned, having erroneously thought she’d truly hit the jackpot this time. From this, one might easily think this premise has a solid foundation for an outrageous, uproarious comedy, but, sadly, the film lives up to its potential only some of the time. To be sure, there is some genuinely hysterical, wonderfully inventive material here, but it only hits the mark about half the time. What’s more, much of the story (especially in the film’s first half) is predictable, almost clichéd, with some bits dragging on needlessly long. Indeed, I’m somewhat mystified as to what all the critical fuss is about, something perhaps best evidenced by the picture’s capture of the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the event’s highest honor. I readily admit to being a fan of Baker’s work, having immensely enjoyed his previous efforts “Red Rocket” (2021), “The Florida Project” (2017) and “Tangerine” (2015). But I’m genuinely at a loss to understand the level of praise that’s been lavished on this release. It’s a capable film in a number of respects, but the filmmaker clearly has done better, and those prior offerings make better viewing options in my opinion.

Anora,Romance,"Anora is a film that starts off strong, pulling you in with an intriguing setup and a well-paced first act.

Anora,Romance,"Sean Baker's Oscar-winning ""Anora"" presents a peculiar paradox of contemporary cinema: a film celebrated for its supposed boundary-pushing that ultimately offers little beyond its taboo subject matter. At 139 minutes, Baker's tale of a sex worker who briefly marries into Russian wealth before facing brutal rejection stretches a thin premise far beyond its natural breaking point.

Mikey Madison delivers a performance of remarkable depth, finding nuanced humanity in a character that the screenplay itself seems uninterested in fully exploring. Her work transcends the material, suggesting emotional complexities the script merely gestures at. Madison deserves every accolade for creating a compelling person where the screenplay offers only a situation.

The film's moments of genuine comedy provide welcome relief but highlight the fundamental problem: ""Anora"" mistakes setting (sex work) for substance. When compared to Jean-Luc Godard's ""Vivre sa Vie,"" which used prostitution as a lens to examine profound questions of autonomy, capitalism, and gender, Baker's film feels superficial. Godard achieved more philosophical depth in 83 minutes than Baker manages in over two hours.

Contemporary cinema increasingly confuses progressive subject matter with progressive thinking. Merely depicting marginalized experiences without offering fresh insight or formal innovation becomes a hollow exercise. One cannot help but wonder whether ""Anora"" received accolades for what it attempted to say rather than what it actually achieved.

The central narrative - a woman from difficult circumstances discovering she can be loved for herself - is neither original nor developed with particular insight. What might have been a focused, powerful short film instead becomes a meandering feature that suggests profundity without delivering it.

Baker's technical competence is evident, but technical skill alone cannot disguise the absence of a compelling artistic vision. ""Anora"" ultimately represents cinema that has forgotten the difference between depicting life and illuminating it.",sean baker oscar winning anora presents peculiar paradox contemporary cinema film celebrated supposed boundary pushing ultimately offers little beyond taboo subject matter minutes baker tale sex worker briefly marries russian wealth facing brutal rejection stretches thin premise far beyond natural breaking point mikey madison delivers performance remarkable depth finding nuanced humanity character screenplay seems uninterested fully exploring work transcends material suggesting emotional complexities script merely gestures madison deserves every accolade creating compelling person screenplay offers situation film moments genuine comedy provide welcome relief highlight fundamental problem anora mistakes setting sex work substance compared jean luc godard vivre sa vie used prostitution lens examine profound questions autonomy capitalism gender baker film feels superficial godard achieved philosophical depth minutes baker manages two hours contemporary cinema increasingly confuses progressive subject matter progressive thinking merely depicting marginalized experiences without offering fresh insight formal innovation becomes hollow exercise one help wonder whether anora received accolades attempted say rather actually achieved central narrative woman difficult circumstances discovering loved neither original developed particular insight might focused powerful short film instead becomes meandering feature suggests profundity without delivering baker technical competence evident technical skill alone disguise absence compelling artistic vision anora ultimately represents cinema forgotten difference depicting life illuminating,Negative
Fifty Shades of Grey,Romance,"Honestly, it has been a long time since I've watched such a bad movie.

The script is just ... stupid and the dialogues even worse. The characters are not believable. I mean, when you watch Twilight, you just swallow the whole thing because it is fantasy and ... OK, it is just a stupid vampires story but, this is just toooooooo bad.

I've not read the book but I suspect the fail is not just in the movie but that it is adapting something that is already bad from the beginning.

The worst is that I kind of liked Dornan in his role in Fallen but this movie has made me realize what a short range of performing resources he has. Dakota Johnson is not too bad, though. The acting is OK, it is just that you hate such an stupid character.

However, let's be honest, you aren't sitting down to watch the film because of dialogue or plot.

You're watching it because of sex. And, out of all the movies, this one actually delivers the most on it. AND, unlike all the sequels, it doesn't claim to be about anything else. It advertises itself as a movie about kinky sex and it delivers as being a movie about kinky sex.

Fifty Shades of Grey,Romance,"Now I never read the book, and the DVD of this has been sitting in a box for years until recently when, discovering it did actually get both an Oscar and a Grammy nomination, I thought I would give it a go. It's all about ""Anastasia"" (Dakota Johnson) who goes to interview hunky gazillionaire ""Christian"" (Jamie Dornan) in his plush office. A bit of flirting ensues as he makes it quite clear that he is interested - but boy, is she in for a surprise when she discovers that all belts and braces does actually having another meaning (as does butt-plug!). What now follows is, I felt, a really tame exercise in soft porn that is about as sexy as putting out the wheelie bin. Dornan is very easy on the eye, but otherwise we are all subjected to a dull, ploddingly produced series of poorly lit scenes that drag on interminably. There's no point evaluating the acting nor the script, they don't matter. This is just a poor attempt to entertain or shock or both that does neither, remotely. Titillatingly tantalising?

Fifty Shades of Grey,Romance,"<em>'Fifty Shades of Grey'</em> is exactly what I expected it to be. I was hoping it wouldn't be too cringey, but it most certainly is just that. In total fairness, it's not one I'd class as it being awfully bad, though that's only thanks to the two leads and the (now well known) music.

There is enough chemistry between Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, they are good actors so are able to alleviate the many mundane moments. The only issue I hold for either is Dornan's accent. I know him and his Northern Irish voice, so the American chatter took me out a bit.

Of course this is a movie largely about the sex, I guess parts of which are OK but too much made me cringe or raise my red flag (as intended for the latter, I hope). The run time should've been trimmed, it does feel like the characters go in circles for large periods - 90min movie all day.

The music is solid, to be fair. Admittedly I already knew and liked the songs from Ellie Goulding and The Weeknd, nice to link them to the movie that made them though. So all in all, not for me.

Wicked,Romance,"The film adaptation of Wicked is based on the Broadway musical, which is a loose adaptation of the 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire. Both Maguire’s novel and the musical are expansions of L. Frank Baum’s original The Wizard of Oz novel was published in 1900 and its film adaptation in 1939. The musical is one of the longest-running and financially successful Broadway musicals of all time.

With a screenplay by Winnie Holzman (writer of the book of the Wicked musical) and Dana Fox (Cruella) and directed by Jon M. Chu (Now You See Me 2, Crazy Rich Asians), Wicked begins around the time The Wizard of Oz ends. The Wicked Witch of the West has died and Glinda the Good Witch is breaking the news to Munchkinland. As the munchkins celebrate and burn a giant, Wicker Man-style witch in celebration of the witch’s death, Glinda is asked by one of the munchkins if she knew the witch.

What follows is nearly three hours of how a green-skinned, outcast girl named Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) whose emotions spark wondrous fits of unbelievable magic interacts with the spoiled, entitled, and pink-infatuated Galinda (Ariana Grande) as they enroll in a magic school known as Shiz University.

Visually, Wicked is jaw-dropping and beautiful. All of the talking animals look extraordinary and every sequence with the flying monkeys is a visual highlight. Peter Dinklage voices a goat teacher named Dr. Dillamond and he has one of the most emotional arcs in the film. The bear nurse and dog doctor in the opening moments of the film look so good for what little amount of screen time they have.

Given how many VFX teams are credited in the film, it’s no wonder the CGI looks intricately gorgeous. The three VFX teams with the most credits in Wicked include OPSIS (The Fall Guy, Rescue Rangers), Framestore (Gladiator II, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice), and ILM (Venom: The Last Dance, Alien: Romulus). Then there’s various work from about a dozen different other VFX teams/houses, but the most intriguing one is one called FoyProAI.

FoyProAI doesn’t have an accessible official website, but some digging around on an executive producer’s LinkedIn page gives some background. Foy stands for Fountains of Youth and FoyProAI specializes in de-aging, up-aging, and beauty work in film. They’ve worked on Smile 2, John Woo’s The Killer for Peacock, and 400 shots on Wicked.

There are moments of greatness in Wicked that mostly stem from the chemistry between Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Grande’s comedic roots, specifically her time and experience on SNL, really come into play here. Grande is essentially the comedic relief as Galinda as her outgoing personality carries most sequences while Erivo has more of a straightforward performance that has more of a dry delivery.

But the generic musical formula is infuriating. Story beats pause and go out of their way to cater to multiple songs at times and it logically hurts your brain. Yes, it’s a musical and yes people are going to sing. But when the main characters are trying to get away on a flying broom as guards are pounding at the door and they spend another ten minutes dancing, crying, and bellowing about their broken friendship it becomes a nuisance. Get on the damn broom and sing on the way to your destination. It doesn’t seem that hard.

Some sequences are thrown in solely because they’ll make a big song more appealing (the whole rotating library straight out of Inception thing) or side stories that don’t go anywhere because two characters need to seem closer than they are (Elphaba and Fiyero’s awkward ten-minute excursion into the forest to free a lion cub). These are both roundabout executions that take the long way to showcase that Fiyero thinks reading is dumb and that he’s actually in love with Elphaba over Galinda.

The film adaptation seems like it’s quite faithful to its source material, but the Hollywood concept of transforming nasty and recognizable villains into sad, relatable characters that the audience roots for is a dumpster fire of a concept. Pure asshole villains can be fantastic too and often make protagonists more interesting if done right.

But the musical fantasy film treats Elphaba like dirt for the first hour and a half. Everyone looks down on her because of the color of her skin. Then when she finally becomes friends with Galinda, she develops a soft spot for mistreated animals. It’s the main reason she turns against The Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) apart from being one of the only characters who can read magic spells.

Wicked is Mean Girls at Hogwarts as everybody sucks and is superficial apart from a character that is supposed to be evil. Elphaba mostly accepts the role of wicked witch because her beliefs don’t match anyone else’s and she’s unwilling to adapt to their ways solely to keep the peace.

Wicked features some unreal VFX and even touches on some incredible ideas from time to time, but the ideas that work seem to stem from capitalizing on a fantasy world that was established over a century ago. As a film, Wicked conjures song after song and drags on and on solely because it’s a bloated musical that wants you to die a rhythmic, sometimes undecipherable, high-pitched death.",film adaptation wicked based broadway musical loose adaptation novel wicked life times wicked witch west gregory maguire maguire novel musical expansions l frank baum original wizard oz novel published film adaptation musical one longest running financially successful broadway musicals time screenplay winnie holzman writer book wicked musical dana fox cruella directed jon chu see crazy rich asians wicked begins around time wizard oz ends wicked witch west died glinda good witch breaking news munchkinland munchkins celebrate burn giant wicker man style witch celebration witch death glinda asked one munchkins knew witch follows nearly three hours green skinned outcast girl named elphaba cynthia erivo whose emotions spark wondrous fits unbelievable magic interacts spoiled entitled pink infatuated galinda ariana grande enroll magic school known shiz university visually wicked jaw dropping beautiful talking animals look extraordinary every sequence flying monkeys visual highlight peter dinklage voices goat teacher named dr dillamond one emotional arcs film bear nurse dog doctor opening moments film look good little amount screen time given many vfx teams credited film wonder cgi looks intricately gorgeous three vfx teams credits wicked include opsis fall guy rescue rangers framestore gladiator ii beetlejuice beetlejuice ilm venom last dance alien romulus various work dozen different vfx teams houses intriguing one one called foyproai foyproai accessible official website digging around executive producer linkedin page gives background foy stands fountains youth foyproai specializes de aging aging beauty work film worked smile john woo killer peacock shots wicked moments greatness wicked mostly stem chemistry cynthia erivo ariana grande grande comedic roots specifically time experience snl really come play grande essentially comedic relief galinda outgoing personality carries sequences erivo straightforward performance dry delivery generic musical formula infuriating story beats pause go way cater multiple songs times logically hurts brain yes musical yes people going sing main characters trying get away flying broom guards pounding door spend another ten minutes dancing crying bellowing broken friendship becomes nuisance get damn broom sing way destination seem hard sequences thrown solely make big song appealing whole rotating library straight inception thing side stories go anywhere two characters need seem closer elphaba fiyero awkward ten minute excursion forest free lion cub roundabout executions take long way showcase fiyero thinks reading dumb actually love elphaba galinda film adaptation seems like quite faithful source material hollywood concept transforming nasty recognizable villains sad relatable characters audience roots dumpster fire concept pure asshole villains fantastic often make protagonists interesting done right musical fantasy film treats elphaba like dirt first hour half everyone looks color skin finally becomes friends galinda develops soft spot mistreated animals main reason turns wizard oz jeff goldblum apart one characters read magic spells wicked mean girls hogwarts everybody sucks superficial apart character supposed evil elphaba mostly accepts role wicked witch beliefs match anyone else unwilling adapt ways solely keep peace wicked features unreal vfx even touches incredible ideas time time ideas work seem stem capitalizing fantasy world established century ago film wicked conjures song song drags solely bloated musical wants die rhythmic sometimes undecipherable high pitched death,Negative

I've been a Wicked fan since 2010. My expectations for this film were extremely high! And I was blown away by how Jon M. Chu was able to bring this story a new life. Everyone involved did an excellent job! The choice to sing live paid off! Not one note was out of tune! Bowen Yang & Bronwyn James were absolutely hilarious as Phannee & Shen Shen. Marissa Bode was fantastic as Nessarose. Can't wait to see her story continue in Part 2. I hope they include ""Wicked Witch of the East"" in the Part 2 Soundtrack. Ethan Slater was great as Boq. I'm excited to see how he becomes the Tin Man in Part 2 because that's not shown on stage. He transforms behind the cabinet but I hope we actually see it in Part 2. Michelle Yeoh was great in every scene as Madam Morrible. She was very Wicked! Jeff Goldblum was amazing as The Wizard! I loved the new version of The Grimmerie! The way it opened was very cool! Jonathan Bailey was incredibly charming as Fiyero! Dancing Through Life was very well choreographed and his singing was great! Loved the way he met Elphaba in this version. I'm very intrigued to see him become The Scarecrow in Part 2. Ariana Grande was absolutely phenomenal as Glinda! She embodied everything about Glinda! Loved her homages to past Glindas in Popular. Her voice was very Angelic. You can tell that she studied a lot for this role. Can't wait to hear her ""I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)"". Cynthia Erivo stole the show as Elphaba Thropp. She poured her heart into this character! I'm so excited to hear ""No Good Deed"" in Part 2! She was incredible! As for the Cameos in One Short Day, Loved seeing Stephen Schwartz as The Guard & Winnie Holtzman as an Emerald City Resident. Love the expansion of the Wizomania show to include Kristin & Idina telling the story of The Grimmerie. Loved that Idina did her Elphie Battle Cry. It didn't take away from Cynthia's at the End. The Film was meant to happen in 2024. Had it come out in 2016 or 2019, I don't think it would've been as well done as it was! I can't wait to see Part 2 and how much of The Wizard of Oz they include.

Wicked,Romance,"OK, so I'm going to be swimming against the tide a bit with this, but I didn't love it. We start where the ""Wizard of Oz"" story finishes off, only without the catchy ""Ding Dong the Witch is..."". Instead we get an ensemble dance number that is energetically performed, colourful and expertly choreographed but instantly forgettable. Then we meet ""Galinda"" (Ariana Grande) who arrives in her pink bubble to confirm the news and enjoy the celebrations. Turns out, though, that she and the erstwhile ""Wicked Witch of the West"" were once friends and so back in time we go to the birth of a little green baby who may (or may not) have been conceived within the bounds of happily married wedlock. Scoot on many years more and we discover that said green person - ""Elphaba"" (Cynthia Erivo) is accompanying her wheelchair bound sister ""Nessarose"" (Marissa Bode) to the ""Ozian"" equivalent of ""Hogwarts"" where she encounters the snobbish ""Galinda"" and a fairly comprehensive degree of hostility. Luckily for her, the legendary sorceress ""Madame Morrible"" (Michelle Yeoh) spots some hidden talent in this young woman and soon she is sharing rooms with her new nemesis and finding herself the butt of school jokes. Then enter the mischievous prince ""Fiyero"" (Jonathan Bailey) who tends to treat everyone the same and who's been kicked out of more schools that he can shake a sceptre at. He does, however, manage to create an environment in which everyone can get along and that's when things begin to change for an ""Elphaba"" who is to be made likeable by her now pally roomie. When a letter arrives from the all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) summoning her to the ""Emerald City"", then they set off hoping to find answers to all of their questions, only to find that nothing there is as it seems... I have to admit that JB has been a friend of mine for many years, so I ain't going to be saying anything bad about the man who might just be the next ""007"", and both Erivo and Grande do well enough with the set piece musical numbers - especially the lively and cleverly written ""Populer/lar"", but the rest of this just struck me as ""Harry Potter"" goes to the musicals where it meets ""Mean Girls"". Goldblum makes his presence felt, but in the same slightly affected fashion that he aways does, and though the visual effects are all fantastic, somehow they are all just so much more sterile to watch than when you see them within the confines of a theatrical stage - where this works so much better, and without the need for the commercially exploitative part 1 and part 2 released months apart. To be fair, everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves, there's a fun number from Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth and Bailey brings some much needed charm to the proceedings but I'd probably just prefer a director's cut that offered us the whole story in one three hour chunk so we can get that mediocre ""Defying Gravity"" power ballad out of the way (repeatedly) in one fell swoop.

Wicked,Romance,"It’s quite a rare occurrence these days when a much-anticipated film actually lives up to all of its pre-release hype, but this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical truly does so in every regard. Director Jon M. Chu has brilliantly brought to life the back story behind the lives and relationship of the two witches from the original L. Frank Baum novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 classic screen adaptation, as well as Gregory Maguire’s 1995 prequel novel, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. In this stunningly beautiful and delightful big-screen production, viewers learn how the supposedly evil Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) came to know the purportedly Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande-Butera), sorcery students and college roommates whose relationship initially went through a series of changes from unabashed contempt to solid friendship. However, as high-level political intrigue unfolds in their homeland of the magical land of Oz – efforts clandestinely spearheaded by the supposedly all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and university headmistress Mme. Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) – Elphaba and Glinda become unwittingly caught up in the high-stakes subterfuge playing out around them, a development that jeopardizes the future of their friendship and the stability of Oz itself. The filmmaker thus subtly but effectively presents audiences with a fable on the nature of good and evil, particularly in terms of what actually constitutes wickedness, especially when it’s skillfully veiled. The result is a thoughtful and thoroughly entertaining tale replete with stunning musical numbers, excellent choreography, ample humor, gorgeous cinematography, an inspired production design and superb performances by the four principals, all of whom are certain to be strong awards season candidates (quite a recommendation coming from someone who unapologetically makes no claim to being a fan of musicals). More than that, though, “Wicked” is an insightful treatise on the quest for power and learning how to make judicious use of it, both in personal dealings and in matters of wider consequence, a fitting cautionary tale for our times (or any time, for that matter). If I had any complaint here, it would be my concern that this is yet another example of a story that’s been divided up into two installments, a growing trend that I don’t believe will ultimately serve the movie industry well. According to the director, this was seen as a necessary step to do justice to the source material, given that it would have been nearly impossible to cram everything into one picture without doing major damage to the content. And, to give the filmmaker the benefit of the doubt, perhaps that will ultimately prove true with the release of part 2 in 2025 (but I’ll reserve judgment on that for the time being). In the meantime, though, this first part comes through as promised, and, in this day and age, that’s a cinematic miracle in itself.",quite rare occurrence days much anticipated film actually lives pre release hype screen adaptation hit broadway musical truly every regard director jon chu brilliantly brought life back story behind lives relationship two witches original l frank baum novel wonderful wizard oz classic screen adaptation well gregory maguire prequel novel wicked life times wicked witch west stunningly beautiful delightful big screen production viewers learn supposedly evil elphaba cynthia erivo came know purportedly glinda good ariana grande butera sorcery students college roommates whose relationship initially went series changes unabashed contempt solid friendship however high level political intrigue unfolds homeland magical land oz efforts clandestinely spearheaded supposedly powerful wizard jeff goldblum university headmistress mme morrible michelle yeoh elphaba glinda become unwittingly caught high stakes subterfuge playing around development jeopardizes future friendship stability oz filmmaker thus subtly effectively presents audiences fable nature good evil particularly terms actually constitutes wickedness especially skillfully veiled result thoughtful thoroughly entertaining tale replete stunning musical numbers excellent choreography ample humor gorgeous cinematography inspired production design superb performances four principals certain strong awards season candidates quite recommendation coming someone unapologetically makes claim fan musicals though wicked insightful treatise quest power learning make judicious use personal dealings matters wider consequence fitting cautionary tale times time matter complaint would concern yet another example story divided two installments growing trend believe ultimately serve movie industry well according director seen necessary step justice source material given would nearly impossible cram everything one picture without major damage content give filmmaker benefit doubt perhaps ultimately prove true release part reserve judgment time meantime though first part comes promised day age cinematic miracle,Negative
Wicked,Romance,"Very good! I enjoyed <em>'Wicked'</em>.

Always impressive when a long run time flashes by - no doubt a sign of a sturdy movie. 2hr 40mins is how long this one lasts, I thought I might have felt that whilst watching but, honestly, I didn't. Since sharing my reviews online I have appreciated musicals much more, to the point that when I learn a film is from this genre it barely registers.

I have never seen the stage musical, in fact the only detail I knew for certain was that it was from the world of <em>'The Wizard of Oz'</em> - which, in turn, I only know from the 1939 and 2013 movies, as well as one or two other flicks. As such, I wasn't actually sure where they were heading with the Wicked Witch of the West - but I approve.

Cynthia Erivo impresses as the aforementioned. I have to say, mind, that Ariana Grande is the person onscreen that stood out most. She does an excellent job at making her character's self-centered quirks so convincing, while also producing a few amusing moments too. Jonathan Bailey and Peter Dinklage are good, while Jeff Goldblum certainly fits his role.

The ending, whilst perfectly fine and pleasing, is possibly a bit rushed/abrupt, though that's to be expected given it's only part one. The same can be said for most films that are split into multiple productions, to be fair. I am intrigued to see where part two goes, bring on this time next year.

Wicked,Romance,"https://good.film/guide/haters-will-tell-you-wicked-sucks-heres-why-theyre-wrong

Broadway hits rely on a suspension of disbelief. With the right ingredients, even the oddest of ideas can take flight on stage… but in the delicate translation to screen, they crash-land. Take Cats: something about that core premise of humans playing felines – which theatre audiences lapped up (sorry) for decades – just didn’t work at the movies.

From the outside, it’s easy to paint Wicked with the same brush. Isn’t it all a bit… silly? There’s a blonde Godiva who floats in a bubble. A green woman who was raised by a bear (and whose father may or may not be a wizard). And when they meet at a Hogwarts-style university, we find out their professor, Dr. Dillamond, is a talking goat. These aren’t exactly the trappings of a thoughtful, award-winning piece of drama. But peel back the colours of any GOOD fantasy and you’ll usually find the allegories are rich and meaningful. With its themes of parental guilt, absent fatherhood, disability, discrimination and class supremacy, Wicked is no exception.

Look, we’re not saying Wicked’s perfect. At 2 hours 40 minutes, it’s knocking HARD on the “too long, wrap it up!” door. And there’s characters that either overdo it a bit (Governor Thropp) or arguably, don’t add much at all (oh Pfannee, do you even go to this school?).

But that’s a bit like complaining about a scratch on a speedboat. A sleek, wondrous craft that can whiz you somewhere thrilling, and change you along the way. We didn’t have crazy high expectations – hey, the everyday moviegoer isn’t a hardcore Broadway fan – but honestly? You don’t need to be. Wicked is a movie for anyone. And maybe that’s why it feels so GOOD.",https good film guide haters tell wicked sucks heres theyre wrong broadway hits rely suspension disbelief right ingredients even oddest ideas take flight stage delicate translation screen crash land take cats something core premise humans playing felines theatre audiences lapped sorry decades work movies outside easy paint wicked brush bit silly blonde godiva floats bubble green woman raised bear whose father may may wizard meet hogwarts style university find professor dr dillamond talking goat exactly trappings thoughtful award winning piece drama peel back colours good fantasy usually find allegories rich meaningful themes parental guilt absent fatherhood disability discrimination class supremacy wicked exception look saying wicked perfect hours minutes knocking hard long wrap door characters either overdo bit governor thropp arguably add much oh pfannee even go school bit like complaining scratch speedboat sleek wondrous craft whiz somewhere thrilling change along way crazy high expectations hey everyday moviegoer hardcore broadway fan honestly need wicked movie anyone maybe feels good,Negative

Wicked,Romance,"I so wanted to hate it.

I didn't like the decision to split the musical into two films. I didn't like the casting. I HATED the trailer, where it made the film look like it was baked with plastic, glossy CGI, or even worse Gen-AI.

And I was wrong.

Erivo and Grande are stellar. The co-stars aren't who I'd have picked, but they're quite excellent themselves. (Particularly the folks playing Bok and Nessa.) 

It's a glorious, beautiful, and joyful film in many ways. When Elphaba finally soars, my heart soared as well and I found myself tearing up. 

I also appreciated how it gives a nod to the much, much darker book, especially with the propaganda posters and effigy in the opening, and the various references to Oz's takeover. (Like when the stone edifice falls off the side of the school building revealing the animals beneath.)

My only complaint is, as with any two or three-parter, lots of the filler is garbage. This is especially true  of the Dancing Through Life number, which becomes unbearably long and significantly less magical because of the added content. 

Still, highly recommended. 8/10 Stars.",wanted hate like decision split musical two films like casting hated trailer made film look like baked plastic glossy cgi even worse gen ai wrong erivo grande stellar co stars picked quite excellent particularly folks playing bok nessa glorious beautiful joyful film many ways elphaba finally soars heart soared well found tearing also appreciated gives nod much much darker book especially propaganda posters effigy opening various references oz takeover like stone edifice falls side school building revealing animals beneath complaint two three parter lots filler garbage especially true dancing life number becomes unbearably long significantly less magical added content still highly recommended stars,Negative
Wicked,Romance,"Wicked by Jon M. Chu is an ambitious adaptation that largely delivers on its promise to bring the magic of the beloved musical to the big screen. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vibrant set pieces and a cinematic take on Oz that feels both familiar and fresh. Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba brings an emotional depth that truly captures the character’s struggles, while Ariana Grande’s Glinda adds a balance of charm and humor. Together, their performances anchor the film and make the story’s core themes, friendship, identity, and societal perception, shine.

The musical numbers are undeniably the movie’s highlight. Songs like ""Defying Gravity"" are powerful and beautifully staged, though I couldn’t help but feel the choreography, while good, could have been taken a step further to truly elevate the experience. The pacing is a mixed bag, with the first act taking its time to set the stage, which may feel slow for some. That said, once the story finds its rhythm, it balances the emotional beats with grandeur fairly well, though the shifts in tone could have been smoothed out more.

Overall, Wicked succeeds as a visually impressive and emotionally resonant adaptation, even if it stumbles in a few places. It’s a solid film for fans of the musical and newcomers alike. While there’s room for improvement, particularly in pacing and choreography, it’s hard to deny that the performances and visual storytelling make it a worthwhile watch.",wicked jon chu ambitious adaptation largely delivers promise bring magic beloved musical big screen visually movie stunning vibrant set pieces cinematic take oz feels familiar fresh cynthia erivo elphaba brings emotional depth truly captures character struggles ariana grande glinda adds balance charm humor together performances anchor film make story core themes friendship identity societal perception shine musical numbers undeniably movie highlight songs like defying gravity powerful beautifully staged though help feel choreography good could taken step truly elevate experience pacing mixed bag first act taking time set stage may feel slow said story finds rhythm balances emotional beats grandeur fairly well though shifts tone could smoothed overall wicked succeeds visually impressive emotionally resonant adaptation even stumbles places solid film fans musical newcomers alike room improvement particularly pacing choreography hard deny performances visual storytelling make worthwhile watch,Positive
After,Romance,"‘After’ is this weird blend of ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ meets ‘Riverdale’ but never gets to the dumb fun both those are, nor does it have the sex appeal of those properties (there is a reason he is facing away from the camera on the poster). ‘After’ does not belong in cinemas nationwide; it’s even below Netflix's standards. It’s more of a YouTube original, or even just something to release on the Wattpad site for free. Still, the book’s sequels have been slated for production, so it looks like we’ll be suffering once again in 2020.

Me Before You,Romance,"**Changing one's fixed mind is not an easy task.**

Based on the novel of the same name, directed by a new lady filmmaker. This British film has two young sensation Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke in the important roles. The story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker. Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.

After a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.

Anyway, the film avoids the usual cliché. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.

On the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.

Forrest Gump,Romance,"""Forrest"" (Tom Hanks) isn't the sharpest tool in the box, but he has an heart of gold and an unparalleled sense of human decency. These laudable characteristics are the result of an upbringing by his mother (Sally Field) which has seen him grow from the bullied young boy from Alabama who discovers that he can run a little faster than your average bear, to a sort of national hero. We learn all this from him as he sits at a bus stop chatting to an initially disinterested nurse, and then to a collection of fellow travellers who learn of his drafting to Vietnam. That's where he meets ""Lt. Dan"" (Gary Sinese) and his new best friend ""Bubba"" (Mykelti Williamson) and where his innate sense of what's right saves lives and earns him the plaudits of a grateful nation (and gets his butt-ox on television too!). His army days taught him much, but nothing so useful as a skill at table tennis. Soon on the American ping-pong squad in China, he manages to get an endorsement that allows him to reunite with the hippified, now paraplegic and disillusioned ""Lt. Dan"" and make a mint shrimp fishing, before returning home to face some fairly predicable family trauma. All of this has been happening against a story of a longing for his one true love. ""Jenny"" (Robin Wright). They've been friends since childhood, but she has a wandering spirit and though his love was requited, it wasn't what he needed. Might there be a future for them, ever? Robert Zemeckis uses a chronology of events in the USA, starting in the 1950s, to create a template for the story of a man who lived through racial tension, war, bullying and emerged the stronger; the more honourable and despite his low IQ was quite capable of putting those more intellectual around him to shame. The photography that cleverly superimposes him into television broadcasts works entertainingly as he gazes bemusedly out onto a audience that is increasingly warming to him. I will admit, I struggled a bit with the running segment towards the end, but Hanks epitomises determination and integrity with Eric Roth's adaptation of the Groom novel allowing plenty of philosophical food for thought whilst having a laugh at scenarios both serious and ridiculous.

The Notebook,Romance,"Touching!

Despite evidently not watching this until today, I've always heard about the sad tag that many associate with <em>'The Notebook'</em> - and I can see why. Given I didn't know anything other than that, I was not anticipating how the film portrays its story - which is effective and rather heartbreaking. I'm not one to get properly emotional to movies, though hit the feels this one does still certainly do.

The film features impressive performances from Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, as well as James Garner and Gena Rowlands. In smaller roles, Joan Allen and James Marsden are relatively solid too.

The Notebook,Romance,"**_Love story in the 1940s near the coast of South Carolina_**

An aged man at a nursing home (James Garner) reads a romantic tale of two young lovers around the WW2 years (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) to a woman with dementia (Gena Rowlands). Sam Shepard plays the young man’s father while James Marsden is on hand as his competitor.

""The Notebook” (2004) comes in the tradition of romantic dramas like “Message in a Bottle,” “A River Runs through It” and “Legends of the Fall.” It may not be as good as “River,” but it’s not as contrived as “Message” and arguably on par with “Legends.” There are bits that also bring to mind two movies from 1991, “Paradise” and “The Man in the Moon.”

If you appreciate any of these flicks, you’ll probably like this one. Rachel is a highlight, naturally, and you can’t beat the 1940s milieu. The end goes on a little too long, however.

It runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot mostly on location in the greater Charleston area, as well just outside Montreal for the wintery battlefield sequence and Los Angeles for the rocky beach scene.

Final Destination Bloodlines,Horror,"Imagine if your room-mate kept getting recurring nightmares that she was going to find herself impaled on a rusty bit of iron after falling from a collapsed revolving restaurant hundreds of feet in the air? Yep - I’d probably just quietly put a pillow over her head one night, too. Luckily, “Stefani” (Kaitlyn Santa Reyes) gets to go home and try to get to the bottom of things. When she mentions this to her family, it turns out that the dream has it’s roots in fact and that is all comes down to whacky grandma “Iris” (Gabrielle Rose) who lives in a remote location that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a “Mad Max” movie and who has her own theory about just what happened on that very night, fifty years ago, and about death. As with the other “Final Destination” series, death is much more of an animate object with a plan, a scheme and boy does it not like it when a plan doesn’t come together. Pretty swiftly, the young lass concludes that over the intervening years the grim reaper has been settling scores and now it is the turn of her family. They all think she’s bonkers, but when their attitudinal cousin “Erik” (Richard Harmon) finds himself having an exceptionally narrow escape, they begin to sit up and take notice. Thing is, though, do they seriously think they can thwart the original man with the scythe? You know that expression about a moth fluttering it’s wings by the Amazon and there being an tsunami in Sri Lanka? Well some of the deathly cause and effect scenarios here are just as entertainingly far fetched as we learn to appreciate the terrors of some otherwise benign garden implements, a nose-ring and a rusty old weathervane - to name but a few instruments - that can be used to facilitate our always brutal and gory journey to the hereafter. The disasters-in-waiting are all fairly visually teed up for us, so we can anticipate the grizzle before it inevitably occurs - but what we can’t always do is anticipate just how these incidents will pan out. Death may have a plan, but it’s an adaptable one and as the family start to dwindle in typically slasher-horror fashion we are able to pick out favourites (mine was the annoying “Aunt Brenda” (April Talek)) and hope that they might be next! This is enjoyable stuff that needs to be watched in the spirit intended. No, the script isn’t up to much nor are any of the standard acting performances from the Blumhouse book of scream then run before making implausible decisions and ending up - well you know how that usually pans out.

Final Destination Bloodlines,Horror,"<em>'Final Destination Bloodlines'</em> is unexpectedly terrific. I watched the original five movies two months ago and highly enjoyed the first flick, though the subsequent follow-ups weren't the best (though I did like <em>'Final Destination 5'</em>). This is the best sequel, no doubt.

What I wanted going in was mindless fun and cool deaths. For me, it ticked both of those boxes with full conviction. I think I gained entertainment from every offing, which is pleasing. They are very nicely done, rather creative too. I'm sure the plot has holes, but honestly... <a href=""https://youtu.be/RsYi2VH2y6U?si=EYdGbleQqyzUPFt6&t=2"" rel=""nofollow""><i>""we don't care""</i></a>.

The cast are all pleasing, there isn't anyone who blew me away or anything but I did really enjoy those onscreen here. Kaitlyn Santa Juana is the standout, but Gabrielle Rose, Richard Harmon and the rest (I see you, Teo Briones of <em>'Chucky'</em>) are all good value. The special effects are satisfying, as well.

I will state that the film is possibly more funny than I think it intends to be, which isn't a bad thing whatsoever for me but I did sense it wasn't quite intending to be as amusing as it is in parts; even if they are, of course, going for laughs still. Maybe I'm wrong. All's well that ends well, either way.

I'd rank this higher than the original. There isn't much in it, but this does narrowly outdo that one in my opinion. Kudos to all involved, because this release could've easily went down like a lead balloon (that sounds like a plot for one of these films; I want compo if that's what FD7 turns out to be, New Line Cinema).",em final destination bloodlines em unexpectedly terrific watched original five movies two months ago highly enjoyed first flick though subsequent follow ups best though like em final destination em best sequel doubt wanted going mindless fun cool deaths ticked boxes full conviction think gained entertainment every offing pleasing nicely done rather creative sure plot holes honestly href https youtu rsyi vh u si eydgbleqqyzupft rel nofollow care cast pleasing anyone blew away anything really enjoy onscreen kaitlyn santa juana standout gabrielle rose richard harmon rest see teo briones em chucky em good value special effects satisfying well state film possibly funny think intends bad thing whatsoever sense quite intending amusing parts even course going laughs still maybe wrong well ends well either way rank higher original much narrowly outdo one opinion kudos involved release could easily went like lead balloon sounds like plot one films want compo fd turns new line cinema,Negative

Final Destination Bloodlines,Horror,"Frankly I'm amazed at the glowing reviews. Whilst ""Final Destination: Bloodlines"", isn't a bad film, its not without its shortcomings. 

On the upside acting is competent, the story-line predictable but polished, with believable, relatable, characterisations. There's also a competently handled dose of sixties nostalgia, that taps into the kinds of fears anyone who has  eaten at a revolving restaurant, perched atop a tall tower, might entertain. Having eaten at two, one in Hong Kong and another in China, myself, this felt familiar and did make me chuckle (nervously).

Where I believe, this film falls down, is it could have crafted, cunningly clever kills, without the need to make them gratuitous. I found this aspect of the film, off putting and I probably wont watch another, for this reason. Its cheap, tasteless, sensationalist and frankly, unnecessarily degrades, what otherwise, could have been an eerily entertaining experience.

Dangerous Animals,Horror,"I suppose if you are called “Zephyr” then you’re likely to be a bit of a free spirit, so when we meet this one (Hassie Harrison) we ought not to be surprised that she does pretty much what she likes when she likes. That includes having a one night stand with the rather drippy but fit-looking realtor “Moses” (Josh Heuston) before she absconds before pancakes to ride the waves. Thing is, she’s got no fin key so has to borrow one from the friendly “Tucker” (Jai Courtney) whom we already know is a bit of a wrong ‘un. Next thing, she awakens tied to a bed on a boat next to “Heather” (Ella Newton) with both ready to star in the ultimate in horror flicks sustained only by Vegemite sandwiches (on stodgy white bread, too!). With him holding all the cards, things don’t look  too good for these two women but luckily “Zephyr” is a gutsy and resourceful young woman and meantime the hapless and pining “Moses” is concerned that she has gone missing-in-action and is trying to find out where she’s gone. Can fate be thwarted? Can he track down his chum in time? Hmmm.

Bring Her Back,Horror,"From Australian twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou (Talk to Me), Bring Her Back follows brother and sister Andy (Billy Barratt) and Piper (Sora Wong). Piper is mostly blind (she can see shapes and colors) and Andy has taken care of her for as long as they can both remember.

When Andy and Piper’s father dies suddenly, they are adopted by a woman named Laura (Sally Hawkins). Laura has a mute son named Oliver (Jonah Wren Phillips) and had a daughter who was also blind and is still grieving her death.

What begins as an awkward transition during tragedy becomes an abhorrent struggle for survival as Andy and Piper eventually uncover what Laura has planned for them.

Talk to Me was a riveting horror debut by the Philippou brothers/RackaRacka and had the benefit of being injected with the incredible concept of chasing the high that comes with being possessed. Bring Her Back is a bit more familiar as it deals with a woman attempting to bring her daughter back to life in the body of a similar vessel.

Cinematographer Aaron McLiskey and sound effects editors Lachlan Harris and Lee Yee deserve a ton of credit for making certain elements of Bring Her Back look and feel like someone with impaired vision is experiencing them.

Visually, the film often focuses on what’s taking place in the foreground while the background is blurry with just enough movement for the brain to piece together what’s occurring. When Piper and Andy are in Wendy’s (Sally-Anne Upton) office, the woman in charge of placing them in the foster care system, the first thing you see and hear are the bracelets on Wendy’s wrist as she types.

In the sequence when Andy is driving Piper to Laura’s house for the first time the visor is down during a sunny day. Andy notices that Piper can’t see or feel the warm color of the day and puts the visor up, which sees an immediate change in Piper’s behavior and body language.

Andy and Piper find their deceased father in the shower, which results in Andy having a traumatic response to showers throughout the rest of the film. During their father’s wake and every time Andy considers taking a shower, Andy has a panic attack. Andy breathes heavily and understandably looks shaken during these sequences, but it’s highlighted by the way the sounds of the world are muffled by his accelerating heartbeat.

The concept of the film is that the living situation with Laura is meant to only be a temporary thing. In three months, Andy will be old enough to apply to be Piper’s guardian. Laura, who has slowly been figuring out a way to bring her daughter back this whole time seemingly waiting for a blind girl to end up in the local foster system, meets the siblings with mind games the minute they walk in the door.

Like Talk to Me, Bring Her Back is jarring and relentless at times with unsettling moments going a step beyond what would be physically comfortable. Oliver’s moment in the kitchen with the knife is a solid example. The highlight of the film is Sally Hawkins's performance. Hawkins has never shied away from challenging films, but Bring Her Back is her first interaction with the genre and she delivers in every way imaginable.

Laura is a nasty character with one goal in mind and Hawkins's performance blurs the line between pure terror and actual empathy for her. While Laura downright murders people in Bring Her Back and commits all these heinous acts, she is still a mother who has never gotten over losing the person she cared about the most in this world. And part of you still feels sorry for her by the end of the film.

The juxtaposition of what Laura is presenting as a seemingly caring foster mother and the dark ritual she’s planning for Piper is somewhat disappointing. Knowing Laura’s intentions so early on in the film (it’s given away in the title and all of the marketing of the film) makes some of the slower moments in the film feel a bit longer than they should. How the film slowly reveals what’s going on with Oliver is a bit more satisfying.

There’s a palpable tension early on where Laura seems like she could either be a gypsy-like character that dabbles in some sort of dark arts or just has a weird infatuation with the dead but cares about the well-being of Andy and Piper. Riding that tension a little bit longer where the film could have felt like it could have gone either way may have had a better payoff. It feels like modern horror films, especially the ones from this year, give a peek behind the curtain too soon and you’re left riding this varying wave of monotony.

Bring Her Back is another mesmerizing effort from the Phillipou brothers with gnarly sequences that teeter on being fully gruesome. Sally Hawkins portrays a nurturing nightmare of a motherly figure to terrifying perfection.",australian twin filmmakers danny michael philippou talk bring back follows brother sister andy billy barratt piper sora wong piper mostly blind see shapes colors andy taken care long remember andy piper father dies suddenly adopted woman named laura sally hawkins laura mute son named oliver jonah wren phillips daughter also blind still grieving death begins awkward transition tragedy becomes abhorrent struggle survival andy piper eventually uncover laura planned talk riveting horror debut philippou brothers rackaracka benefit injected incredible concept chasing high comes possessed bring back bit familiar deals woman attempting bring daughter back life body similar vessel cinematographer aaron mcliskey sound effects editors lachlan harris lee yee deserve ton credit making certain elements bring back look feel like someone impaired vision experiencing visually film often focuses taking place foreground background blurry enough movement brain piece together occurring piper andy wendy sally anne upton office woman charge placing foster care system first thing see hear bracelets wendy wrist types sequence andy driving piper laura house first time visor sunny day andy notices piper see feel warm color day puts visor sees immediate change piper behavior body language andy piper find deceased father shower results andy traumatic response showers throughout rest film father wake every time andy considers taking shower andy panic attack andy breathes heavily understandably looks shaken sequences highlighted way sounds world muffled accelerating heartbeat concept film living situation laura meant temporary thing three months andy old enough apply piper guardian laura slowly figuring way bring daughter back whole time seemingly waiting blind girl end local foster system meets siblings mind games minute walk door like talk bring back jarring relentless times unsettling moments going step beyond would physically comfortable oliver moment kitchen knife solid example highlight film sally hawkins performance hawkins never shied away challenging films bring back first interaction genre delivers every way imaginable laura nasty character one goal mind hawkins performance blurs line pure terror actual empathy laura downright murders people bring back commits heinous acts still mother never gotten losing person cared world part still feels sorry end film juxtaposition laura presenting seemingly caring foster mother dark ritual planning piper somewhat disappointing knowing laura intentions early film given away title marketing film makes slower moments film feel bit longer film slowly reveals going oliver bit satisfying palpable tension early laura seems like could either gypsy like character dabbles sort dark arts weird infatuation dead cares well andy piper riding tension little bit longer film could felt like could gone either way may better payoff feels like modern horror films especially ones year give peek behind curtain soon left riding varying wave monotony bring back another mesmerizing effort phillipou brothers gnarly sequences teeter fully gruesome sally hawkins portrays nurturing nightmare motherly figure terrifying perfection,Positive

The Ritual,Horror,"I’m guessing that Russell Crowe was busy for this latest exercise in priestly exorcism so an hardly recognisable Al Pacino decided to have a go. He is a Capetian father drafted in to help the reluctant Fr. Joseph (Dan Stevens) with a particularly difficult task. Fr. Theophilus must help rid the poor young Emma (Abigail Cowen) of an unwanted bodily guest. His methods do not impress the rather naive young father, nor the sisters in attendance as she increasingly resorts to involuntary bleeding, foul language, violent outbursts and even the usual hanging upside down from the ceiling lamp trick whilst under relentless assault from the repetitious bible verses being read across what I counted are at least seven of those ritual attempts at expulsion. Sound familiar? Well that’s because it is. Aside from Pacino turning in a slightly different style of performance from his norm, the rest of this hasn’t an original bone in it’s body. Indeed, its only claim to fame appears to be that it is based on the original, almost century old, transcriptions from Fr. Joseph of events that are really supposed to have happened but we’ve seen this all predictably play out so many times before that even the traditional collapsible bed doesn’t turn an head - spiritual or metaphysically. The one element that does provoke a little interest is, perhaps, the clear indication that Catholicism in the 1920s was riddled with incantations, superstitions and a degree of symbolism that probably hadn’t changed since much since there was a Borgia on the throne of St. Peter. This might work on the telly at Halloween of you’re full of Grappa, but as a cinema experience it is disappointing and entirely forgettable, sorry.",guessing russell crowe busy latest exercise priestly exorcism hardly recognisable al pacino decided go capetian father drafted help reluctant fr joseph dan stevens particularly difficult task fr theophilus must help rid poor young emma abigail cowen unwanted bodily guest methods impress rather naive young father sisters attendance increasingly resorts involuntary bleeding foul language violent outbursts even usual hanging upside ceiling lamp trick whilst relentless assault repetitious bible verses read across counted least seven ritual attempts expulsion sound familiar well aside pacino turning slightly different style performance norm rest original bone body indeed claim fame appears based original almost century old transcriptions fr joseph events really supposed happened seen predictably play many times even traditional collapsible bed turn head spiritual metaphysically one element provoke little interest perhaps clear indication catholicism riddled incantations superstitions degree symbolism probably changed since much since borgia throne st peter might work telly halloween full grappa cinema experience disappointing entirely forgettable sorry,Positive

Sinners,Horror,"Set in 1932 in Clarksdale, Mississippi, Sinners takes place throughout one night in the middle of October. Sammie Moore (the feature film debut of Miles Caton) is at a crossroads in his life. He is torn between being the son of a preacher and the blues-driven nightlife where he gets to sing, play guitar, and feel alive. Sammie submerges himself in the blues seemingly having little desire to return to his family’s religious roots.

Sammie’s twin cousins Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan) have just returned home after spending seven years in Chicago. With a mobster-like reputation, the twins intend to jumpstart a new jukejoint at an old sawmill previously owned by Klan members. However, they want the grand opening to be that very night, have several arrangements to be made, and have little time to get it all done.

As dusk turns to night and the twins’ new club seems to be off to a successful grand opening, an unspeakable evil lurks on their doorstep waiting to be invited in.

Writer and director Ryan Coogler (Black Panther, Creed) was highly inspired by the works of Robert Rodriguez, so it’s no surprise that Sinners feels like a blacker and more blues-driven version of From Dusk Til Dawn. Sinners is a supernatural action horror film, but it takes its time getting to the horror. The first half of the film is like a well-written gangster film mostly driven by dialogue while introducing a cast of characters that are mostly all worthwhile and entertaining in their ways.

Smoke and Stack have two extremely different personalities with opposing fates in Sinners, which must have been incredible for Michael B. Jordan. Smoke is more serious and lethal like a soldier while Stack is more eccentric and playful in his demeanor. Smoke also wears blue while Stack wears red. The dual performances allow Jordan to dip his toes into being a hero and a villain, two different types of music, and the dark and the light.

This is a vampire film, but it’s also a film about music. Music is the most important aspect of Sinners. The film states that the power of music can heal communities and attract evil. The initial battle between those within the club and the outside dwelling vampires starts as a mostly blacks versus whites standoff but evolves into something much more elaborate.

Like all Ryan Coogler films, Sinners is extremely black-centric but the film also incorporates several different nationalities in a period when whites thought they were the only decent race. The grocery store owners are Chinese, a biracial girl follows Stack from the north back down to the south, and Remmick (Jack O’Connell), the lead vampire, is introduced being chased by Native Americans. The African aspects allow for a deeper appreciation for the film’s stellar score and put much-needed rejuvenation to the cinematic vampire.

Sinners is also a clashing of music genres with the human characters strumming on the blues side of things while the vampires and outsiders lean into Irish folk music and jig dancing. There is this jaw-dropping sequence within the wooden walls of Club Juke when Sammie finally gets to show how talented he is as a musician. It showcases all types of music, classic and contemporary, that have essentially evolved from or been inspired by gutbucket blues (blues or jazz music featuring raw emotions and a gritty, soulful sound).

Vampire folklore is toyed with in a way that is incredibly satisfying in Sinners. The concept of being invited in is something the film approaches extremely well. Music is utilized by both sides to either attempt to keep the living together and safe or to lure them outside to become part of a red-eyed, bloodthirsty pack of undead. There’s the typical lore you expect in a vampire film like trying to use garlic to fend them off and making wooden stakes to drive through their hearts.

But in other vampire films if you kill the head vampire it can either cure those that have been changed or kill all of them. Sinners takes a different route stating that each vampire has to be killed regardless on if their leader is slain. Hoodoo also plays a major part in the film. Wunmi Mosaku (His House, Deadpool & Wolverine) portrays Annie. Annie has an emotional connection to Smoke, but she also practices hoodoo, which allows her to be the voice of reason when bodies start piling up.

Sinners is one of the horniest films to come out of the first part of the year. Films have kind of shied away from showcasing nudity and sex with recent films. Everyone in Sinners is bursting with lust and when they’re not in the middle of copulating or performing cunnilingus or fellatio they’re talking about it in graphic detail.

Sinners,Horror,"It’s always gratifying to see a filmmaker take a big step up in his or her career, and that’s precisely what writer-director Ryan Coogler has done in his latest offering, a project that reflects a significant jump in the depth, artistry and sophistication of his creative output. Coming on the heels of his successes in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” (2022), “Creed” (2015) and “Fruitvale Station” (2013), Coogler has hit a home run with this period piece smart horror story about identical twin brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who return to their Mississippi home in 1932 after years of working for Al Capone in Chicago, where they made huge money that they now plan to use to open their own juke joint in a converted sawmill. It’s an opportunity where they hope to make even bigger bucks while helping to promote their talented cousin, Sammie (Miles Caton), a blues musician who’s a killer guitarist and vocalist. But, as this ambitious trio launches this effort, they’re confronted with a variety of challenges, including ghosts from their past, the perils of deeply ingrained social prejudice, the dual-edged sword posed by creative and financial success, and, most menacingly, mystical forces that may be more than they’re capable of handling. These narrative components combine to tell a captivating tale about a troubled time in the country’s history, one made all the more ominous with the appearance of supernatural powers that simultaneously offer both potential promise and the prospects of tremendous evil taking root. In bringing this picture to life, the filmmaker has served up an entertaining and engaging offering, one replete with fine performances, superb production values, sharp-edged, perfectly timed comic relief, truly inventive, deftly orchestrated cinematography, and suitably restrained (graphic though not gratuitous) imagery. Admittedly, the screenplay could use some work in a few spots (most notably with tighter writing and clearer plot elaboration), but it also manages to successfully fuse the inherent nature of several genres, including drama, dark humor and smart horror, while also presenting a wealth of insights in an array of areas. Through this picture, it’s easy to see how Coogler has appreciably upped his game as a filmmaker, one that bodes well for his future in the field. It indeed represents the revelation of a talent more profound than anyone has previously recognized or properly acknowledged. “Sinners” is a work that deserves to be remembered come awards season later this year.

Sinners,Horror,"<em>'Sinners'</em> is a fair load of fun. It admittedly didn't fully knock my socks off, but there isn't any doubt that it is a very good film. It's stylish with impressive music and visuals, whilst all of the acting talent give good performances. It's paced astutely too.

Michael B. Jordan is as entertaining as he usually tends to be, I do like seeing him act. The dual role is done well here, the 'split screen' is solid but my brain sillily - no matter the movie or standard of how they portray the same actor twice - simply cannot interpret the effect as seamless.

Jack O'Connell stands out behind Jordan, particularly for the moments of sing. Hailee Steinfeld and Wunmi Mosaku are the others that I took notice of too, same can be said for Delroy Lindo, Li Jun Li and Omar Miller; I oddly always think of <em>'American Pie Presents: Band Camp'</em> with the latter (I'm so sorry, Omar).

I must say, the trailers revealed too much. I tend to avoid those so assume I didn't get the full brunt of it anyway, though even so I remember catching a couple of bits that don't occur until the gritty part of the movie. It's no biggie, trailers are designed to get bums on seats after all.",em sinners em fair load fun admittedly fully knock socks doubt good film stylish impressive music visuals whilst acting talent give good performances paced astutely michael b jordan entertaining usually tends like seeing act dual role done well split screen solid brain sillily matter movie standard portray actor twice simply interpret effect seamless jack connell stands behind jordan particularly moments sing hailee steinfeld wunmi mosaku others took notice said delroy lindo li jun li omar miller oddly always think em american pie presents band camp em latter sorry omar must say trailers revealed much tend avoid assume get full brunt anyway though even remember catching couple bits occur gritty part movie biggie trailers designed get bums seats,Negative
Sinners,Horror,"I don't think I liked it as much as most people seem to, and definitely not as much as the critics, but think this movie nailed about 85% of what it tried to.

The setting, music, costumes, makeup, gore, and effects were exceedingly well done. The film is well-acted (Delroy Lindo was the standout) and it was definitely worth seeing in the theatre. 

My only complaints are that the ending felt rushed, there are a couple of oddly out of place surrealist sequences, and the villain was weak. It's a fairly long film already, but I think it would have been better if we'd gotten to see another 10 minutes of the interaction between the villain and his initial pursuers, and a few flashbacks would have been helpful. 

I also think this story would have worked better as a TV series, but still, a very original and enjoyable film.

Sinners,Horror,"Sinners started off similar to a gritty drama in the Deep South, every character felt so built and I was fully invested.  Then the vampire elements started twirling in. That first fade into the moon, the guitar riff, unbelievably hard Mr. Coogler. It gave a feeling I haven’t felt since watching dune 2. Oh and the scene where we go through the history and future of music, best scene of the decade maybe? That juke joint was heaven for clarksville that night, a place where people could finally let loose and forget about all their work to enjoy powerful music, rooted in their ancestry. I ascended to heaven, and I’m not coming back down.


Under here is a review I wrote in a discord server you don’t need to read it it’s pretty basic:


Sinners is the new film from Ryan Coogler, and his first fully original story. This movie just proves how awesome and competent of a director Ryan Coogler is. This movie expertly genre blends drama with horror, which all encompasses the theme of black ownership, music, and religion. 

Sinners is one of the best new movies I’ve seen this decade. The cinematography (which I luckily saw in 70mm IMAX) was so beautiful and had chills every time the frame would expand to show off a landscape, and breathtaking sunsets and sunrises. Sometimes the frame would transition from a haunting 🤫 to a beautiful moonlight which was backed by the 10/10 musical score. I will mention more later.

BTW this movie has one of the BEST SEQUENCES that will make you ASCEND IN YOUR SEAT. Jaw was dropped. It’s not even a horror sequence.

The horror elements are so well used in this movie, it’s like kissing somebody and you get a tingle everywhere when something awesome happens. Everything is so badass and goes hard. The action made me shake for the whole 3rd act, it ruled. The end got very emotional too. So so so freaking perfect. See this in a theater.

Oh yeah the score. THE GUITAR SHREDDING AT THE BEST TIMES OHOOHOHOHOOH

Sinners,Horror,"Michael B. Jordan is “Smoke” and twin brother “Stack” in this classy drama of a pair who’ve lived on the wrong side of the tracks for most of their lives, but have determined to go home and try to go straight. To that end, they buy an old barn and hope to set up their own speakeasy - with only a nominal nod to prohibition - pumping to the rafters with dancing and blues music. On the way, they ally with talented musician “Sammie” (Miles Caton) and, of course, there’s a bit of baggage for the siblings as they return to a town that’s not altogether welcoming. Once home, a mixture of confidence, threats and collective charisma succeeds in assembling a crowd for their opening night. Pretty swiftly, though, that grand celebration attracts the attention of some travellers who are keen to join the party, but perhaps in true Charlie Daniels style, they have an altogether more menacing agenda. This is the cinematic equivalent of an LP, this film. It starts with one side gradually introducing us a rich collection of characters all of whom could quite plausibly have lived in Mississippi at a time when segregation was as rife as illicit booze, and the two more recently hailing from Chicago gives things a certain gangster element too. There is also a very subtly powerful effort from Hailee Steinfield as “Mary” too. The flip side of the record proceeds to develop some elements of peril with the story, and that’s where it rather runs out of steam for me. It tries very hard to create a sense of hot, sweaty and frenzied jeopardy, but maybe because it has already taken quite a long time to get to this stage, that all comes across as a bit rushed and lacking in punch. It looks great, the visual effects are convincing enough and the production design smoulders perfectly. In the end, though, whilst it proves that MBJ is comfortably able to hold a story, Ryan Coogler has overly relied on a marvellously toe-tapping musical score that has been left to do much of the heavy lifting. That latter point is made more essential by a mediocre audio mix that can make the dialogue quite difficult to make out more often than I’d have liked. This seems to be an increasing issue as directors become more ambitious with their visual aspirations leaving the one thing that cannot be readily faked/augmented - the sound - left at the altar. It’s a cinema film, and will look distinctly average on a television so big screen and soundtrack audio is essential to get the best from this silky looking story with an interesting twist at the end, and again at the very end.",michael b jordan smoke twin brother stack classy drama pair lived wrong side tracks lives determined go home try go straight end buy old barn hope set speakeasy nominal nod prohibition pumping rafters dancing blues music way ally talented musician sammie miles caton course bit baggage siblings return town altogether welcoming home mixture confidence threats collective charisma succeeds assembling crowd opening night pretty swiftly though grand celebration attracts attention travellers keen join party perhaps true charlie daniels style altogether menacing agenda cinematic equivalent lp film starts one side gradually introducing us rich collection characters could quite plausibly lived mississippi time segregation rife illicit booze two recently hailing chicago gives things certain gangster element also subtly powerful effort hailee steinfield mary flip side record proceeds develop elements peril story rather runs steam tries hard create sense hot sweaty frenzied jeopardy maybe already taken quite long time get stage comes across bit rushed lacking punch looks great visual effects convincing enough production design smoulders perfectly end though whilst proves mbj comfortably able hold story ryan coogler overly relied marvellously toe tapping musical score left much heavy lifting latter point made essential mediocre audio mix make dialogue quite difficult make often liked seems increasing issue directors become ambitious visual aspirations leaving one thing readily faked augmented sound left altar cinema film look distinctly average television big screen soundtrack audio essential get best silky looking story interesting twist end end,Negative

Sinners,Horror,"Sinners (2025) – A Spiritual, Sonic, Soul-Shaking Masterpiece

There are films that claim to echo with heart, with history, with heritage—and then there is ""Sinners,"" Ryan Coogler’s audacious, transcendent blend of Gothic folklore, musical soulcraft, and cultural reclamation. It doesn’t just echo. It sings. It howls. It bleeds. From its first frame to its devastating final image, Sinners is a full-bodied spiritual experience masquerading as horror—a rare, roaring anomaly that doesn’t fit inside a genre but redefines what cinema can be when it chooses truth over trope.

At the centre of this cinematic exorcism is music—not as adornment, but as DNA. The film’s heartbeat is the blues. And it is through that heartbeat that Coogler tells a tale steeped in generational trauma, Black identity, post-war brotherhood, the spectral weight of history, and the enduring fight for Black ownership in the face of cultural erasure. But unlike anything we've seen before, Sinners fuses those themes with a chilling yet poetic vampire mythos that feels entirely earned, never performative. It is horror, yes—but elevated horror. Arthouse. Operatic. Biblical.

The Blues as Bloodline

Set in the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s, Sinners follows twin brothers Smoke and Stack—both played, exquisitely and with startling distinction, by Michael B. Jordan—who return home to open a juke joint. This place, more than a bar, becomes a church of sorts: a sanctuary of soul, a communal hearthstone where Black folk gather to drink, dance, and reclaim their joy. The walls of the juke joint hum with possibility. With danger. With prophecy. Even if only for one night.

And then there’s the moment. The moment that marks ""Sinners"" not just as a great film, but a holy text of black magic. Sammie, the film’s humble preacher-boy turned guitar savant, takes to the stage. He plays the blues—slow, aching, ancestral. As he sings, the camera glides across the dance floor in a long, liquid motion, capturing the swelling ecstasy of Black joy. And then the music begins to evolve. It morphs, imperceptibly at first, weaving through the history of Black music—African tribal chants, gospel, jazz, funk, soul, R&B, hip-hop—all spiralling into the foundation laid by the blues. It's not a medley; it’s a resurrection. An invocation. This is music as invocation. And in that moment, it summons something darker.

Outside the joint, stands the vampire Remmick, captivated by the sounds, eyes glowing like embers, face lit with a deranged smile. He listens intently, staring into the soul of their cultural history as the place is set spiritually ablaze. Sammie's music called to something ancient. Something seductive. Something that knows the blues because it was born of the same sorrow.

A Clash of Cultures—Scored to Perfection

What Coogler and composer Ludwig Göransson achieve with the film’s score is revolutionary. The music is not just thematic; it is political. It is narrative. When the scenes pulse with Black culture, the music leans blues, jazz, rhythm. But when Remmick and his fellowship—white vampires born of pain and craving—invade, the score rips into metal, into noise. The clash is jarring. Purposeful. It feels like an act of war. The blues is not just an aesthetic—it’s a battlefield. And the music becomes the weapon, the shield, and the lament.

The result is a full-body experience. As Remmick’s power grows, the music becomes louder, more aggressive, less familiar. It’s a stunning metaphor: Black culture, as it always has, being appropriated, corrupted, and consumed until it’s unrecognisable to those who birthed it. And yet, it fights back. Every scene feels like a spiritual wrestling match, waged through melody and rhythm.

Remmick: The Devil At The Door

Jack O’Connell gives a performance so disturbingly charismatic you almost want to follow him into the dark and join his fellowship. Remmick isn’t just a villain—he’s a prophet of perversion.

A being who believes, earnestly, that he is liberating the people he turns. He doesn’t kill for sport; he offers salvation through eternal night. He doesn’t deny his love for Black culture—he craves it. He worships it. He believes the blues is a divine language, one that called him into existence. His monologues are lyrical and damning, his gaze never cruel, always convincing. You don’t root for him. But you understand why someone would.

One scene in particular—outside the joint, where he sings “Picked Poor Robin Clean” in the dark with his newly-turned—should be studied. It is eerily beautiful, the harmony between vampire and victim pitch-perfect, terrifying. When he and his hive recite the Lord’s Prayer in unison with Sammie, the lines between the sacred and the profane dissolve entirely. It’s religious horror at its most potent—unflinching, unforgettable.

Brothers in Arms, Brothers in Grief

Jordan’s dual performance as Smoke and Stack is nothing short of masterful. Stack is lighter, a dreamer. Smoke is war-weathered, clenched, sceptical. But together, they form a complete man—until tragedy forces one to stand alone. There’s a small scene near the end that shattered me more than any of the horror sequences. Smoke, shaking, tries to roll a cigarette for himself, something Stack always did for him. He fails. His hands tremble. A moment so small, yet so laden with grief, PTSD, and love that it lingers long after the credits roll. Coogler knows the power of silence. Of memory. Of unspoken bonds. And I appreciate the care that went into making sure a detail so seemingly small, was given a fitting final detail, that reassured me of the passion that went into every single god damn scene.

The Voice That Summoned the Storm

Miles Caton’s debut as Sammie Moore doesn’t just mark the arrival of a new talent—it announces a generational voice. At just 20, Caton steps into the role of the preacher’s son with a presence that feels both timeless and urgent. His musical roots run deep—raised in a gospel-rich family, he’s been singing since the age of three, and his voice carries that lineage with soulful weight.

Caton not only sings in Sinners but co-wrote the haunting original track “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” with Alice Smith and composer Ludwig Göransson. Learning blues guitar in just two months for the role, his performance in the juke joint sequence is a revelation—channeling pain, power, and prophecy in equal measure. It’s no wonder director Ryan Coogler described him as “a once-in-a-lifetime voice.” Caton’s portrayal of Sammie is the film’s heartbeat—a blend of innocence and depth that lingers long after the credits roll.

Framing the Fire

Autumn Durald Arkapaw’s cinematography in Sinners is nothing short of masterful. Making history as the first female cinematographer to shoot on large-format IMAX film, she crafts a visual narrative that is both expansive and intimate. Utilizing a blend of IMAX and Ultra Panavision 70 formats, the film’s shifting aspect ratios serve the story’s emotional beats—widening to capture the vastness of the Mississippi Delta, then narrowing to draw us into the characters’ inner worlds.

Night scenes glow with a haunting luminescence, firelight dances with purpose, and each frame feels meticulously composed yet organically alive. Arkapaw’s lens doesn’t just show us the world of Sinners—it immerses us in its soul, making the supernatural elements feel grounded and the historical context visceral. Her work elevates the film, turning each scene into a painting that breathes.

Anchors in the Storm

Delroy Lindo's performance is like jazz—unpredictable, soulful, and necessary. He doesn't undercut the film's tension, but rather gives it breath. In a narrative that leans heavy on atmosphere and myth, he injects a kind of familial levity that feels earned and lived-in. His presence is grounding, a reminder of what’s at stake when the horror threatens to strip the story of its humanity. And then there’s Hailee Steinfeld, as Mary, bringing a layered grace to the screen—mischievous, magnetic, and caught between identities. Raised with Smoke and Stack, her loyalty runs deep, but her character exists in a space that blurs lines—between belonging and otherness, tradition and disruption. There's a quiet poetry to how her arc unfolds, and you’re left wondering whether she’s a reflection of what it means to straddle cultures, or a symbol of something even more elusive. Either way, she leaves a mark—fierce and unforgettable. And then there's Wunmi Mosaku’s portrayal of Annie, which anchors the film with a quiet yet potent strength. She is a bridge to ancestral wisdom, embodying the resilience and spiritual power of the Black community. Her presence is not loud, but her influence is undeniable—rooted in healing and protection, offering a steady counterpoint to the chaos around her. Annie doesn’t just fight evil with wisdom—she fights to preserve the very soul of her people.

This soul isn't for sale

And in a film layered with metaphor and meaning, black ownership doesn’t just echo—it resounds. It's not a theme that visits—it’s the architecture. And Sammie becomes the embodiment of that principle. His music, his soul, his presence—they’re not just narrative devices, they’re battlegrounds. There’s a moment—powerful, worded like an offer but weighted like a threat—where what’s being asked isn’t blood or vengeance, but ownership of that brilliance. Remmick offers everybody else their lives if they let him take Sammie, but Slim responds ""he's ours."" It’s not a loud moment. But it cuts deep. And it’s in the refusal—in the stillness of collective resistance—that the film finds one of its most potent truths. That cultural power isn’t just about legacy—it’s about protection, unity, and the refusal to be harvested.

Beyond the Oscars

There are films designed to win Oscars. And then there are films like Sinners—films that make awards feel meaningless. Because what do statues mean when you’ve built a monument? Sinners is that monument. To music. To Blackness. To art. To survival. To Cinema. It doesn’t just earn your praise. It earns your soul.

In a world where genre cinema often feels disposable, Sinners is an inheritance. A film made by people who love the culture deeply enough to protect it, critique it, and immortalise it. It is horror not just of the supernatural, but of history, of identity, of being seen and erased all at once.

Sinners,Horror,"ALERT: might be spoilers lurking here.

Thankfully I didn't see any film trailers but I did glance over a few magazine covers to see it was a movie about twins and vampires.

What I didn't know was that it was also a period piece so that was a surprise.

How the vampires appeared was also a surprise. I  thought one of the twins was already a vampire and had somehow hidden it from his brother.

I liked the Stephen King aspect of ordinary day turning to sh!t and good luck surviving.

What was missed in all the reviews I saw here: spiritual and cultural aspects that may have gone over folks' heads.

Did anyone understand Mary's real link to the Black community? What does her survival as a vampire say about that precarious aspect of her previous life versus her life after life?

Did anyone see an almost mockery of religion in the vampires' siren call and the ""triumph"" of the Black church in Sammie's survival?

How does this flow with narratives of good versus evil?

Freedom is an overarching theme. 

Free to go north and work for gangsters. Free to own property/open a juke joint. Free to enjoy an evening of dance and drink. Free to LIVE.

Money is supposed to bring freedom but money that spends only in the Delta won't free anyone. 

Music offers the unification that could quell separatism but isn't always able to deliver the promise.

Musicians forced to play for racists by the police. Vampires singing to lure Sammie out. The singing at church. The singing in the juke joint. Sammie surviving to sing and play for several more decades.

Any freedom in the world of Sinners is temporary at best.

This movie is multi-layered. 

You have to see it multiple times to see it.

you a different perspective each time.",alert might spoilers lurking thankfully see film trailers glance magazine covers see movie twins vampires know also period piece surprise vampires appeared also surprise thought one twins already vampire somehow hidden brother liked stephen king aspect ordinary day turning sh good luck surviving missed reviews saw spiritual cultural aspects may gone folks heads anyone understand mary real link black community survival vampire say precarious aspect previous life versus life life anyone see almost mockery religion vampires siren call triumph black church sammie survival flow narratives good versus evil freedom overarching theme free go north work gangsters free property open juke joint free enjoy evening dance drink free live money supposed bring freedom money spends delta free anyone music offers unification could quell separatism always able deliver promise musicians forced play racists police vampires singing lure sammie singing church singing juke joint sammie surviving sing play several decades freedom world sinners temporary best movie multi layered see multiple times see guessing time see hear something missed time giving different perspective time,Negative
Sinners,Horror,"this movie is absolutely beautiful. i was hesitant to watch it because i don’t care for vampire stories, but this is way more than just a “vampire story.” it shows the beauty of black culture while also discussing the very real aspect of oppression, especially back in the jim crow era, where this movie takes place. the scary scenes were scary, the sad scenes were sad, and everything in between did it’s job correctly. i wish i could see this movie for the first time again. every actor did amazing in this, but miles caton, the actor for sammie, did a phenomenal job… finding out this was his first big role was a shock. this movie is an excellent conversation starter for multiple different topics because of how impactful it is. ryan coogler is a director that is a force to be reckoned with. absolutely stunning movie",movie absolutely beautiful hesitant watch care vampire stories way vampire story shows beauty black culture also discussing real aspect oppression especially back jim crow era movie takes place scary scenes scary sad scenes sad everything job correctly wish could see movie first time every actor amazing miles caton actor sammie phenomenal job finding first big role shock movie excellent conversation starter multiple different topics impactful ryan coogler director force reckoned absolutely stunning movie,Positive

""I Know What You Did Last Summer is a glossy, shallow reboot that mistakes recognition for resonance, failing to revitalize the franchise in any meaningful way.

Despite a few solid performances and flashes of potential, the film never finds its footing as horror, legacy sequel, or even as a character-driven drama. It's not thrilling, it's not moving, and it's certainly not memorable.

28 Years Later,Horror,"Just a wealth of stupid, moronic, and ill-advised ideas.

The film starts out with a fairly strong intro, but the central character here doesn't have any impact on the rest of the film, so it feels wasted. 

It switches plots halfway through after a strong start, inexplicably. 

I assume the new evolved infected were meant to be scary. I found them to be unintentionally hilarious in several scenes, and if you watch this film you'll understand why.

The later portions of the film are just as nonsensical, but in short, it gets more and more absurd as it progresses.

28 Years Later,Horror,"**A beautiful film with a handful of odd choices.**

I was hesitant going into this film. On one hand, it was a mainstream zombie film with a big budget and a competent crew. But on the other hand, it was in a franchise I have never loved, and it was the start of a new trilogy. So, while I was confident that it would be a solid movie, I did not know if it would work for me personally or if it would feel like it could stand on its own. I walked out of the theater satisfied with the film. And in the day since, I have grown even more positive on it and am giving it a **9 out of 10**. I think the part that will surprise people the most is the emotional weight that the film carries. And it all comes from the great set of characters and their relationships. There is a lot of heart and even some great humor to get you invested. This elevates the film above being just another fun zombie movie. But let's talk about the zombies/infected. There are a couple new ideas introduced with them in this that I really dig. They are more monstrous than ever, but they are also showing more humanity than ever. The action and kills are a lot of fun. Everything is as fast and terrifying as usual with this franchise. So, the action is mostly fantastic. I say 'mostly' because there are a couple of editing choices that I think distract from the action more than they enhance it. I can say the same for a handful of other points in the film. They chose to insert flashes of other footage at times. One of the times I loved it. One of the times it was weird and actually felt like a trailer for the movie. And another time, it was just very confusing. (I still don't know the meaning of it) Those are a couple of the times where the style didn't fully work. But for 95% of the film, it does! This film has a look that is so unique. **It feels both calm and like a nightmare at the same time!** I don't know how they did it. If you have seen the awesome trailer, you get a feel for the style of the film. It does not disappoint. Then, there is a scene at the end that sets up the future of the trilogy. This scene has a style and a tone that is like nothing else in the movie. Truly a WTF moment for the audience. It was bold, and it did not work for me. But since it was just a tease to the future films and not integral to this one, I am willing to forgive it. Because before that, we got an actual ending to the film that was emotionally satisfying. This film has no problem standing on its own. Sure, you are left with more to explore, and certain character arcs are left unfinished. But go in knowing it is a trilogy (and that the next one is coming as soon as this January), and these things hopefully won't bother you. - All in all, **I'm a happy zombie fan! :D**",beautiful film handful odd choices hesitant going film one hand mainstream zombie film big budget competent crew hand franchise never loved start new trilogy confident would solid movie know would work personally would feel like could stand walked theater satisfied film day since grown even positive giving think part surprise people emotional weight film carries comes great set characters relationships lot heart even great humor get invested elevates film another fun zombie movie let talk zombies infected couple new ideas introduced really dig monstrous ever also showing humanity ever action kills lot fun everything fast terrifying usual franchise action mostly fantastic say mostly couple editing choices think distract action enhance say handful points film chose insert flashes footage times one times loved one times weird actually felt like trailer movie another time confusing still know meaning couple times style fully work film film look unique feels calm like nightmare time know seen awesome trailer get feel style film disappoint scene end sets future trilogy scene style tone like nothing else movie truly wtf moment audience bold work since tease future films integral one willing forgive got actual ending film emotionally satisfying film problem standing sure left explore certain character arcs left unfinished go knowing trilogy next one coming soon january things hopefully bother happy zombie fan,Negative
28 Years Later,Horror,"What I will say about this movie is it's not all bad. This first half was really good, with an opening that was reminiscent of 28 Weeks Later. Afterwards though, it cuts to completely different characters for basically the rest of the film. Which would be fine and all, just showing a snippet of how the infection was 28 years before the start of the movie, but it does a weird call back in the ending scene that feels extremely out of place compared to the rest of the film. Aside from that, the first half is really good and the tension of survival of a father and son feels heavy and suspenseful, especially with the addition of a new type of infected: the alpha. This new infected is basically a 'roided up super infected that is both smarter and stronger than normal ones. It's only after making it back to the safe village does the movie noticeably change mood to a more coming of age feeling movie, oddly reminding me a bit of Stand By Me.

It's at this point, my enjoyment of this movie kinda began to fall. This latter half just ends up with the boy and his mom going out to find a doctor. The whole trip, it kinda feels like things just happen. And sure, the second half is about accepting death, but it feels so paved over when the boy has a more violent reaction to his dad cheating than the guy who actually kills. It feels so jarring when that scene happens cause it doesn't really fit how the character acted beforehand. 

After all is said and done, boy stays outside of the safe village and wanders where it ends in a bizarre scene of him running into a pack of survivors which one turns out to be the kid from the opening scene. It's so weird cause it a group of 5 who at first I mistook as a gang of grannies doing par-core and brutalizing some runner infected all while some trash metal was playing in the background. I did get a laugh at the fact that I wasn't the only one in the theater wondering what the hell was going on when that scene started.

TLDR: Movie is good and really suspenseful up until they return to base in witch it turns more into a bad attempt of a coming of age story that finishes off with a power rangers type end scene. This whole movie reminds me of what happened with Longlegs. Advertising made the movie seem like a much different movie vs the actual viewing experience.

28 Years Later,Horror,"It’s almost thirty years since Cillian Murphy wandered around in his hospital gown; the so-called “rage” virus still shows no sign of abating and with Britain effectively quarantined from Europe there are few outposts untouched by it’s madness. Protected by the tides, the small island of Lindisfarne is one such bastion and that’s where “Spike” (Alfie Williams) lives with his dad (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his poorly mum (Jodie Comer). It’s a big day in the place when “Spike” is taken to the mainland by his father to make his first kill. That’s not least because he is barely twelve years old and because he has never seen anything of town nor land as far as the eye can see before. He’s also never seen any of the infected before, either. With this trip being fairly fraught and eventful and with one of his family friends at home telling him of a doctor “Kelson” (Ralph Fiennes) who might be able to help his increasingly disturbed mother, the newly emboldened “Spike” comes up with a daring plan to see if he can help make her better. It’s all pretty standard zombie fayre this film but though there is quite a decent effort from the confident young Williams and Comer does lethally equipped confused well too, the rest of it just lacks much for originality.

The movie has good technical quality and the initial sequence with the dad and the child venturing in the open country has the same energy as the first movies, with frenzied zombie pursuits and the feeling you ""can't catch a break"".

This is humanist tale of what it means to inherit a world that's changed but at its core, remains unchanged. Remember, we all live and we all must die. 

In this sense, the tale of zombies, takes a back seat, as the protagonists have to face the reality of survival but just as importantly, the need to remain human. To live, love and accept loss. 

Whilst the first half of this film feels somewhat static (setting the scene but doing little more), the latter half is inexplicably moving, for a film cast in this genre. 

The chemistry and interplay between Jodie Comer, Alfie Williams and Ralph Fiennes characters, is all too familiar and painfully human, in spite of the post apocalyptic setting. Most especially for those of us, who have experienced the loss, of a parent. 

What I could not grasp and I feel robbed this film of a measure of its impact, was the weird parkour zombie scene, with what looked liked fashion extra's from a Benetton ad, at the films end. Why?

In summary, whilst somewhat uneven, the latter half of this film is excellent, ""almost"" to the closing credits. Most definitively worth a look.",years later different film predecessors humanist tale means inherit world changed core remains unchanged remember live must die sense tale zombies takes back seat protagonists face reality survival importantly need remain human live love accept loss whilst first half film feels somewhat static setting scene little latter half inexplicably moving film cast genre chemistry interplay jodie comer alfie williams ralph fiennes characters familiar painfully human spite post apocalyptic setting especially us experienced loss parent could grasp feel robbed film measure impact weird parkour zombie scene looked liked fashion extra benetton ad films end summary whilst somewhat uneven latter half film excellent almost closing credits definitively worth look,Negative
28 Years Later,Horror,"<em>'28 Years Later'</em> delivers a very good flick, I wouldn't rank it too far behind the (albeit superior) original in actuality. I admittedly did think it was going to be more in-your-face unsettling based on a trailer I saw, what with that terrifying (but great!) usage of Rudyard Kipling's ""Boots"".

All the same, it is still unnerving in a good amount of patches; it's, for me, definitely the closest that these films have come to being scary. These movies always nail their casting, whilst this is compartively the weakest cast they still impress. Ralph Fiennes steals the show, mind.

Fiennes is quality, Aaron Taylor-Johnson does bring a strong performance too. Jodie Comer is convincing, while youngster Alfie Williams gives more than what's necessary. Edvin Ryding's part is iffy at first, but by the end I did enjoy him. No complaints with any of 'em.

The final scene is absolutely wild, kinda can't believe they went *there*. I did note the similarities to the fixer instantly but thought I was connecting unconnectable dots, but boy was I spot on. I'm fascinated to see where they go with it; good casting, to be fair.

Not too long to wait for the January 2026 sequel, it'll be worth a watch no matter what given the above. As for this 2025 release, it sure does look the part visually and it happily gives an entertaining story to boot.",em years later em delivers good flick rank far behind albeit superior original actuality admittedly think going face unsettling based trailer saw terrifying great usage rudyard kipling boots still unnerving good amount patches definitely closest films come scary movies always nail casting whilst compartively weakest cast still impress ralph fiennes steals show mind fiennes quality aaron taylor johnson bring strong performance jodie comer convincing youngster alfie williams gives necessary edvin ryding part iffy first end enjoy complaints em final scene absolutely wild kinda believe went note similarities fixer instantly thought connecting unconnectable dots boy spot fascinated see go good casting fair long wait january sequel worth watch matter given release sure look part visually happily gives entertaining story boot,Negative
Clown in a Cornfield,Horror,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://movieswetextedabout.com/clown-in-a-cornfield-movie-review-when-tradition-kills-literally/

""Clown in a Cornfield is a pleasant surprise in the 2025 horror landscape. It starts off rather generically - a conservative town, a group of rebellious teens, a masked killer - but quickly finds its own identity through well-crafted social commentary and a strong execution of slasher tropes.

With solid performances, confident direction from Eli Craig, and a healthy dose of dark humor, the movie wins over its target audience through gory entertainment and thematic relevance, even if not all of its ideas are fully explored and some narrative decisions feel more convenient than organic.

It's a grim but clever portrait of a society in denial, where the past refuses to die… even when it's literally buried in a cornfield.""

Clown in a Cornfield,Horror,"Based on the 2020 novel of the same name by Adam Cesare, Clown in a Cornfield follows 17-year-old Quinn Maybrook (Katie Douglas) and her father (Aaron Abrams) moving to Kettle Springs, Missouri. After the passing of Quinn’s mother the previous summer, Kettle Springs had an opening for a family doctor which caused the surviving Maybrooks to move from the big city to a small rural town.

The local corn syrup factory burned down recently and its mascot, a clown named Frendo, has become a celebratory icon for Kettle Springs. With a town holiday known as Founders Day fast approaching, the townsfolk are noticeably on edge with new people moving in and the younger generation making dreaded internet videos.

As Quinn tries to make friends in a town she never wanted to move to, an actual killing spree by someone wearing a clown costume drenches Kettle Springs in a sea of blood.

The clown sequences in Clown in a Cornfield are the film's highlights. Interestingly, a jack-in-the-box toy pops up whenever someone is about to die prompting you to think of a connection or deeper meaning to Frendo that never actually occurs. But some of the kills are incredibly solid like the gnarly chainsaw kill in the middle of the cornfield, the barbell kill you see glimpses of in the trailer, and a brutal pitchfork sequence that results in two deaths.

Everything in between teenagers getting slaughtered is rather clunky. Clown in a Cornfield doubles down on this The Breakfast Club meets Dead & Buried ambiance, but never quite gets there. Kettle Springs sees MadTV’s Will Sasso as the town sheriff and it’s bizarre. He plays the role completely straight, but Sheriff Dunne is rather forgettable otherwise.

The cast is mostly fine when it comes to passable performances. Katie Douglas slides into her role as Quinn Maybrook more comfortably as the film progresses and as the events in the film become more hectic. Early on in the film, it’s as if Douglas has this permanent pouty face and duck lips expression that is entirely obnoxious.

Kevin Durand is the unexpected delight of the cast though. Durand has always been a supporting actor that is a sleeper hit in whatever he pops up in with Abigail and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes being prime examples. As Arthur Hill, Durand initially comes off as a stereotypical father who is part of a lucrative family that founded the town. But he evolves into something else entirely that is wholly crucial to the circus-themed massacre.

The slasher film introduces a blood feud between the older and younger generations. High school students are sneered at, looked down on, and judged for things they didn’t ever do or think about doing. The sheriff seems to make his laws and teachers dish out detention for no reason.

There’s a reveal regarding Frendo that transpires roughly halfway through the film that feels like it happens entirely too soon. Co-writer and director Eli Craig (Tucker and Dale vs Evil) and co-writer Carter Blanchard (uncredited screenwriter on Independence Day: Resurgence) could have teased this reveal for far longer. It would have been much more satisfying.

The friends that Quinn makes in Kettle Springs are the more popular high school kids but are also the most troublesome. They have a YouTube channel with over 600K subscribers and their content is short horror films featuring one of them dressed as Frendo killing people. It results in this troublesome dynamic where when a clown does start killing people nobody believes them. They don’t even believe it themselves at first even when they start being targeted.

There isn’t a ton of humor in Clown in a Cornfield, but at least two instances come to mind that are fairly amusing. The sequence where Quinn and Janet (Cassandra Potenza) don’t know how to operate a rotary phone is classic and it’s a shame that it’s given away in the trailer. Older technology in general like driving a car with a manual transmission is a concept Clown in a Cornfield explores quite a bit.

There’s also a moment when two girls are tossing around a severed head like a hot potato because they think it’s fake. They have this bitchy back-and-forth that is very LSP from Adventure Time interacting with a minor inconvenience kind of commentary and it’s fantastic.

Clown in a Cornfield displays moments of coulrophobic greatness. Frendo is a brutal psychopath whose weird devotion to the clown art form (like his big shoes that squeak when he walks during the most tense moments of stalking his prey) attempts to make the audience laugh through the moments of terror.

The film is overflowing with palpable teenage energy though. Clown in a Cornfield is based on a young adult novel, so it’s expected but the constant barrage of “adults just don’t understand us” and the nonstop desire to drink themselves stupid at every opportunity becomes predictable and tiresome.

The kills are entertaining, but the young versus old debacle and less than surprising Frendo “twist” makes Clown in a Cornfield decent, but not memorable.",based novel name adam cesare clown cornfield follows year old quinn maybrook katie douglas father aaron abrams moving kettle springs missouri passing quinn mother previous summer kettle springs opening family doctor caused surviving maybrooks move big city small rural town local corn syrup factory burned recently mascot clown named frendo become celebratory icon kettle springs town holiday known founders day fast approaching townsfolk noticeably edge new people moving younger generation making dreaded internet videos quinn tries make friends town never wanted move actual killing spree someone wearing clown costume drenches kettle springs sea blood clown sequences clown cornfield film highlights interestingly jack box toy pops whenever someone die prompting think connection deeper meaning frendo never actually occurs kills incredibly solid like gnarly chainsaw kill middle cornfield barbell kill see glimpses trailer brutal pitchfork sequence results two deaths everything teenagers getting slaughtered rather clunky clown cornfield doubles breakfast club meets dead buried ambiance never quite gets kettle springs sees madtv sasso town sheriff bizarre plays role completely straight sheriff dunne rather forgettable otherwise cast mostly fine comes passable performances katie douglas slides role quinn maybrook comfortably film progresses events film become hectic early film douglas permanent pouty face duck lips expression entirely obnoxious kevin durand unexpected delight cast though durand always supporting actor sleeper hit whatever pops abigail kingdom planet apes prime examples arthur hill durand initially comes stereotypical father part lucrative family founded town evolves something else entirely wholly crucial circus themed massacre slasher film introduces blood feud older younger generations high school students sneered looked judged things ever think sheriff seems make laws teachers dish detention reason reveal regarding frendo transpires roughly halfway film feels like happens entirely soon co writer director eli craig tucker dale vs evil co writer carter blanchard uncredited screenwriter independence day resurgence could teased reveal far longer would much satisfying friends quinn makes kettle springs popular high school kids also troublesome youtube channel k subscribers content short horror films featuring one dressed frendo killing people results troublesome dynamic clown start killing people nobody believes even believe first even start targeted ton humor clown cornfield least two instances come mind fairly amusing sequence quinn janet cassandra potenza know operate rotary phone classic shame given away trailer older technology general like driving car manual transmission concept clown cornfield explores quite bit also moment two girls tossing around severed head like hot potato think fake bitchy back forth lsp adventure time interacting minor inconvenience kind commentary fantastic clown cornfield displays moments coulrophobic greatness frendo brutal psychopath whose weird devotion clown art form like big shoes squeak walks tense moments stalking prey attempts make audience laugh moments terror film overflowing palpable teenage energy though clown cornfield based young adult novel expected constant barrage adults understand us nonstop desire drink stupid every opportunity becomes predictable tiresome kills entertaining young versus old debacle less surprising frendo twist makes clown cornfield decent memorable,Negative
Clown in a Cornfield,Horror,"Ok, so there’s not much original about this cornfield chopper, but I think that’s the point. It sets itself up right from the start as more of a parody of so many other films of the genre, and I really quite enjoyed it. Of course we have to start with the daughter/father relationship that’s reeling from a tragedy, then they move to an old rickety house that really does need it’s chimney seeing to before she sets of to school dressed for a “Rocky Horror” party. “Quinn” (Katie Douglas) quickly falls in the with the town’s rowdy crowd, led by wealthy eye-candy “Cole” (Carson MacCormac) which just earns her the annoyance of her dad (Aaron Abrams) and just about all of the local bigwigs. This lot like to have a few drinks then make spoof horror films in which they get brutally slain by a clown from the cornfield then post them on the internet. It’s when once such frolic turns out to be just a bit more serious that things get altogether more menacing for our troop of teenagers. What now ensues, well you’ve seen it all before lots of times but this time it’s tongue is in it’s cheek, there’s a (pretty obvious) twist in the romantic tale and the whole enterprise is reminiscent of “Scooby Do” does the “Klu Klux Clown”. There’s plenty of screaming histrionics, chainsaws, crawling through sewers and you could bathe like Cleopatra in the amount of ketchup, or corn syrup, that’s splashed about as it races along. If you’re looking for BAFTA acting skills, then perhaps not, but if you can watch this in the context that it is an entertaining satire of those gone before it, then I think it’s quite good fun and who knows, there might even be a sequel.",ok much original cornfield chopper think point sets right start parody many films genre really quite enjoyed course start daughter father relationship reeling tragedy move old rickety house really need chimney seeing sets school dressed rocky horror party quinn katie douglas quickly falls town rowdy crowd led wealthy eye candy cole carson maccormac earns annoyance dad aaron abrams local bigwigs lot like drinks make spoof horror films get brutally slain clown cornfield post internet frolic turns bit serious things get altogether menacing troop teenagers ensues well seen lots times time tongue cheek pretty obvious twist romantic tale whole enterprise reminiscent scooby klu klux clown plenty screaming histrionics chainsaws crawling sewers could bathe like cleopatra amount ketchup corn syrup splashed races along looking bafta acting skills perhaps watch context entertaining satire gone think quite good fun knows might even sequel,Negative

Influencer,Horror,"The social media age lends itself well to the horror-thriller genre, but most films turn out to be a shallow, cautionary tale about the toxicity that comes from our narcissistic desire for more fan engagement and obsession with accruing “likes.” That’s not the case with “Influencer,” a creative and fresh take on movies set in the TikTok and Instagram era. Director and co-writer Kurtis David Harder‘s film embraces the online influencer culture with a project that has shades of “Single White Female” and “Sissy,” and it’s filled with enough psychological suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat.

Madison (Emily Tennant) is a popular social media influencer who planned a lavish trip to Thailand with her boyfriend Ryan (Rory J Saper), who bailed at the last minute. Determined to save her vacation, she heads to the country alone and films videos for her loyal followers, making it seem like she’s have a much better time than she actually is. One night at the hotel bar, she meets CW (Cassandra Naud), a fearless and knowledgeable traveler who offers to take Madison under her wing and show her the most Instagram-worthy locations around. They develop a quick friendship, bonding over food, drinks, and the love of adventure. Things seem to be looking up for Madison until CW takes her for a surprise overnight camping visit to a deserted island that’s completely off the grid.

Instead of the typical story of a man preying on a woman traveling alone, in this scenario it’s a female (which somehow makes her feel more trustworthy). You aren’t concerned for Madison’s safety at first, because CW seems like a really cool, friendly person. Once you begin to feel uneasy about her intentions, it’s already too late. The script, which Harder co-wrote with Tesh Guttikonda, is clever but never annoying, and the narrative goes to as many unexpected places as it does familiar. Although the premise can sometimes feel like something you’ve seen before, the story has enough natural and unforced surprises to keep you guessing and engaged.

A major part of the reason the film works so well is that the story seems plausible and realistic, and the performances from the cast are terrific. Naud is unsettling as a genuine psychopath who is a master of manipulation, and Tennant and Sara Canning as social media superstars are extremely believable in their roles. Harder is a skilled director who handles the material well, and he understands the cinematic language of the thriller.

Some of the best parts of “Influencer” are also the most unexpected, so I have actively avoided revealing too many spoilers in this review. The film offers a chilling look at our natural insecurities, arrogance, and conceit when it comes to our online presence, but it also is a really fun horror-thriller that’s exceptionally satisfying.",social media age lends well horror thriller genre films turn shallow cautionary tale toxicity comes narcissistic desire fan engagement obsession accruing likes case influencer creative fresh take movies set tiktok instagram era director co writer kurtis david harder film embraces online influencer culture project shades single white female sissy filled enough psychological suspense keep edge seat madison emily tennant popular social media influencer planned lavish trip thailand boyfriend ryan rory j saper bailed last minute determined save vacation heads country alone films videos loyal followers making seem like much better time actually one night hotel bar meets cw cassandra naud fearless knowledgeable traveler offers take madison wing show instagram worthy locations around develop quick friendship bonding food drinks love adventure things seem looking madison cw takes surprise overnight camping visit deserted island completely grid instead typical story man preying woman traveling alone scenario female somehow makes feel trustworthy concerned madison safety first cw seems like really cool friendly person begin feel uneasy intentions already late script harder co wrote tesh guttikonda clever never annoying narrative goes many unexpected places familiar although premise sometimes feel like something seen story enough natural unforced surprises keep guessing engaged major part reason film works well story seems plausible realistic performances cast terrific naud unsettling genuine psychopath master manipulation tennant sara canning social media superstars extremely believable roles harder skilled director handles material well understands cinematic language thriller best parts influencer also unexpected actively avoided revealing many spoilers review film offers chilling look natural insecurities arrogance conceit comes online presence also really fun horror thriller exceptionally satisfying,Negative

M3GAN,Horror,"M3GAN achieved its goal perfectly by delivering a hilarious dark comedy that was incredibly aware at how ridiculous the premise is. It had me laughing my ass off and had some pretty decent kills for a PG-13 film, although I think it could have been even better with a hard R rating.

But this film is not just a dark horror comedy, it dives deeper than its surface appeal. Deep down there is intimate social commentary on parents using technology as a crutch. Whenever M3GAN is in the room, Gemma finds it easier to neglect her niece and let's M3GAN take control of the parenting. This makes it much harder for her to get a genuine connection with her to fulfill motherly needs. I found this surprisingly compelling and really does have a genuine impact in today's society, obviously not with life size android dolls but with tablets and phones. Really enjoyed this aspect of the film.

Allison Williams delivered a pretty decent performance; it was nice to see her in another prominent horror role since Get Out. Violet McGraw once again was great as an inspiring child actress; her filmography is beginning to be stacked for her being such a young age. All other performances were quite lackluster, but that is expected in a film of this nature.

Overall, there is not really much more to say. This film is funny, weird, and wildly fun. It's never going to be a standout competitor for award season but there is something to say about the pure entertainment it was able to deliver.

""M3GAN doesn't reinvent the respective subgenre of killer robots or AI that turns against humans, but it kept me entertainingly invested throughout its entire runtime.

Akela Cooper's premise is pushed to its limits - and even beyond - being elevated by excellent performances, a clever satirical narrative, eyebrow-raising killings, and meaningful messages about parenting and technology's role in a child's upbringing.

I was conflicted before seeing the movie. On the one hand, the trailer looked ridiculous. On the other, I knew that Blumhouse and James Wan partnered for this. After seeing the reviews, I finally accepted that I had to see this movie, and I’m glad I did. Was it ridiculous? Absolutely. M3GAN knew what it was. It knew it was cheesy but had fun with it while also cranking up the tension and suspense. So many cliche “stop standing there and do something” moments that surprisingly added to the stress and horror. I wouldn’t say the movie was ever scary, but it was an excellent thriller. It’s a fun Blumhouse film that was self-aware and goofy while creepy and tense. One of my favorite parts was the short scene with one of the worst detectives of all time that had me laughing out loud in the theater.

M3GAN,Horror,"'Cady"" (Violet McGraw) finds herself living with her aunt ""Gemma"" (Alison Williams) after an altercation with a snow truck leaves her orphaned. They don't exactly hit it off. The older woman is a career-driven lady who works at a toy manufacturer, specialising in gadgets and gismos that use AI.

Indeed, actually, at times I found it particularly useful (the neighbour's wayward dog, for example). It's a competently strung together drama, but it's all just a little too sterile and by-the-numbers for me. It does fire a warning shot to parents who could become over-reliant on their children's own reliance on surrogate friendships and dependencies, but once that point is made - and reiterated - the rest of this is, frankly, all rather unremarkable.",cady violet mcgraw finds living aunt gemma alison williams altercation snow truck leaves orphaned exactly hit older woman career driven lady works toy manufacturer specialising gadgets gismos use ai thing market dominance waning much chagrin boss david ronny chiang competitors catching children getting even sophisticated lazy dependent plan though colleagues cole brian jordan alvarez tess jen van epps working ultimate companion doll pairs owner becomes almost sibling like snag film plot really rather predictable acting much find eponymous hideously dressed creation remotely menacing indeed actually times found particularly useful neighbour wayward dog example competently strung together drama little sterile numbers fire warning shot parents could become reliant children reliance surrogate friendships dependencies point made reiterated rest frankly rather unremarkable,Negative
M3GAN,Horror,"**It's an enjoyable film, it carries a pertinent anti-tech message, but it's not even close to being a horror film.**

First, let me make one thing clear: horror movies have an imperative duty to scare and disturb us. Tension, suspense, fear and some scares are something that should not be missing. It's the essence of horror cinema, right? So, can someone explain to me where came from the bad idea of making horror movies for teenagers who aren't old enough to ride a motorcycle? Don't get me wrong… the movie is good, and I liked it, but I can't consider it a horror movie. It is not able to frighten anyone! It has no scares (we are able to predict them from a mile!), it has no tension or suspense. As a horror movie, forget it. As the people say, it rains, but it doesn't get us wet, do you understand?

The script begins with a young girl who loses her parents in a tragic accident and goes to live with an aunt who works in a large corporation of highly technological toys. Things aren't easy and neither of them is prepared for the situation. It is in this context that we met M3GAN, a prototype of a toy that is, basically, an android child that is capable of learning, improving itself, teaching and, basically, replacing parents in the tiring task of… being parents. The problem is that, being a machine, it has no notion of good or bad, right or wrong, and that seems to have been a secondary detail in its programming. So it's no surprise that she quickly turns into a sly, cynical creature who kills without any remorse.

The film was directed by Gerard Johnstone, an illustrious unknown. Who is behind the project is the producer and screenwriter James Wan, who we know from “Saw” and “Conjuring 2”. Wan's brand is everywhere. It would have been better if he had directed it and the project had evolved into a somber film, a true horror piece. Allison Williams does the main character well, giving us yet another excellent job. The actress is living a happy moment in her professional life after having shone in “Get Out” and seems to be managing to take advantage of the opportunities. Amie Donald and Jenna Davis, in turn, give body and voice (respectively) to M3GAN, complementing the work with an animatronic doll created for this purpose.

The animatronic doll is nothing new. Cinema has used this technology for decades, and Spielberg's shark – one of the first and most infamous examples – is proof of that. However, the special effects and CGI are to be congratulated. The film utilizes a number of expensive visual and digital resources to excellent effect, wonderfully complementing what was done in the studio. The sound (particularly the sound effects related to the doll) also deserves praise, and the cinematography, even though it doesn't bring new or innovative features, makes the best use of it all. The film has good costumes and convincing sets, as well as a very good, modern and fun soundtrack. It's on the editing table that things go wrong: either because of the excessive length, or because it wants to target young age groups, the film was badly edited, and the cuts are rough. There are even scenes from the trailer that, because they are not in the final cut, make it difficult to understand the story: for example, the scene where Gemma orders M3EGAN to protect Cady, which appears in the trailer and was cut from the film, but which would help to understand why the doll starts to behave that way to protect its young owner.

The only real fear that this film conveys is the credible possibility that, in the medium term, there will be some toy similar to M3GAN. Advances in AI, computing, robot creation and design, or other technologies make it plausible. Will it be that one day we will have robots and androids that, due to their characteristics, will be considered alive and, as such, immortal and, therefore, superior to the humans who created them? I don't think anyone wants to see that. Therefore, the film carries with it a message of distrust in technology, visible not only in M3GAN, but also in Cady's technological dependence. I can do nothing but applaud: the generations born after the year 2000 saw their childhood dominated by cell phones, iPads or computers, to the point of despising conventional games and toys and alienating themselves from living together, normal and healthy, with other children. I'm not making it up, this is a fact that we can all see in a short trip to any school. And if there are parents who appreciate the creation of devices that keep their children busy, I am in the group of parents who see technology as something that should be dosed in a more measured way, allowing children a normal childhood before introducing them to the digital and tech world.

M3GAN,Horror,"<em>'M3GAN'</em> works for one reason and one reason only: the robot. I could honestly do without the entirety of the scenes that are predominantly about the adults, but the <i>Model 3 Generative Android</i> is, surprisingly, highly entertaining to watch.

The look is good, the effects are very convincing and, unexpectedly, the dialogue really adds to the character; it is lively and amusing, which can't always be said in this genre. They could've perhaps made the robot more unsettling, though it is minorly creepy once or twice.

Allison Williams, despite my lack of overt interest in the older folk, is solid in a prominent role.

M3GAN,Horror,"M3GAN is a fun mix of sci-fi, horror, and satire, playing on our growing fascination (and fear) of AI. The plot is simple but effective, following a tech-driven story that doesn’t waste much time on deep explanations. Instead, it throws us straight into the chaos of a hyper-intelligent AI doll bonding with a child in ways that quickly spiral out of control. While the movie touches on interesting themes about technology and parenting, it doesn't go too deep into the mechanics of M3GAN’s creation, which leaves some questions unanswered. That being said, it still delivers an engaging and entertaining ride.

The directing keeps things moving at a steady pace, balancing horror and humor well. The cinematography is solid, with some nice shots that make M3GAN feel eerily lifelike. The use of lighting and framing helps create an unsettling atmosphere, especially when the doll is in focus. The acting is a mixed bag, while the young girl and the actress behind M3GAN absolutely carry the film, some of the supporting performances feel flat. There are moments where certain characters feel like they’re reading off a script rather than delivering natural dialogue, which can take you out of the moment.

The script is decent, with some sharp moments of humor and tension, but it could have used a bit more depth in certain areas, especially around M3GAN’s development and motivations. The sound design and score work well in building suspense, adding to the film’s creepy but playful tone.

The Substance,Horror,"The Substance delivers an intense, visually mesmerizing commentary on the entertainment industry's obsession with youth and outward beauty. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley offer remarkable, maybe even career-best performances, with Dennis Quaid excelling in his role as well. Coralie Fargeat explores how aging stars, particularly women, are discarded when they no longer meet the industry's strict beauty standards. Moore's character, haunted by the memory of her former fame and beauty, goes down a dark path in pursuit of a ""better"" version of herself. The story is also a sharp critique of power dynamics, with white men controlling who's in front of the spotlight, while women are pitted against one another for validation.

The film's production is equally impressive, especially the makeup and prosthetic work that elevates its body horror elements. While the first half of the movie is more subdued, the gore ramps up significantly as the plot unfolds, culminating in a chaotic ""fourth act"" that will leave audiences bewildered. The fast-paced editing, paired with an impactful score, heightens the tension and surrealism of the narrative. Though there's a part of me who prefers a version of the film that ends before the wild final act, the overall experience is an unforgettable, audacious exploration of vanity, control, and desperation in the entertainment world.

The Substance,Horror,"For a film that’s laser-focused on the human body, it’s gloriously on point that THE SUBSTANCE begins with a freshly cracked, bright yellow egg yolk. 

Eggs are the ‘giver of life’, right? They’re the origin of all of us. Gleaming and plump, the yolk suddenly gets pricked – not by a fork, but a syringe.

That’s the first juicy visual metaphor of many in this meaningfully bonkers body horror, for which French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat picked up the prestigious Best Screenplay prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.

To call the film ‘bold’ is a weapons-grade understatement. It’s an audacious, jaw-dropping examination of what screens & billboards demand of women (especially as they age), and how laughably impossible it is to meet those demands. Well, if you didn’t laugh, you’d cry. After watching THE SUBSTANCE, you might do both.

The Substance,Horror,"There’s a big difference between being funny and being laughable, yet the latest from writer-director Coralie Fargeat has somehow found a way to be both. After amassing a considerable amount of largely well-earned cinematic goodwill in the film’s opening segments, the picture mercilessly squanders that support in the final act with an overlong, meandering, disgustingly gratuitous and grotesque exhibition of utterly bad taste. This story of an aging actress (Demi Moore) who seeks to revive her career by retrieving some of her lost youth with the aid of an enigmatic injectable follows her grand misadventures when the mysterious substance prompts the emergence of a younger doppelganger (Margaret Qualley), who becomes a Hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight. To make this experimental venture work, however, the two individuals must follow a complex set of rules, dictates that become increasingly difficult to follow as they each vie for their respective shares of attention. And, as this scenario unfolds, tension grows between them, leading to complications and unexpected developments that become progressively harder to manage. But that’s where what works in the film ends. As the story plays out from there, it becomes stupendously absurd, and, even though there are some hearty laughs in this, there are even more ridiculously implausible and unexplained occurrences that try audience members’ patience and tolerance, so much so that I couldn’t wait for this trainwreck to end. In addition to the foregoing shortcomings, the film includes myriad changes in tone, making it difficult to determine whether this is supposed to be a serious thriller or a campy road, very much in the same way as in the incomprehensible French offering “Titane” (2021). It also shamelessly “borrows” elements from other movies in various ways, most notably imagery and narrative references from “The Shining” (1980) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), costume designs from the “Hunger Games” franchise, and bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts from films like “Vertigo” (1958). Then there’s the picture’s obvious, heavy-handed message about the perils of misogyny, observations that, as important as they are, could easily stood to have been turned down more than a few notches (yes, we get it already). At the same time, though, there are also some fundamentally innate questions about the narrative that go wholly unanswered, leaving us with numerous head-scratching moments. Sadly, these failings detract significantly from the elements that do work (at least early on in the film), such as the fine performances of Moore and Qualley, the picture’s inventive cinematography, and a central premise that could have made for an engaging story if handled with greater finesse. But these strengths are effectively cancelled by what ultimately results when this release goes off the rails. Indeed, how “The Substance” captured the 2024 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay is truly mind boggling. I’m certainly a fan of the weird, wild and wacky, but this release undermines the virtues of those cherished qualities. Regrettably, I was seriously looking forward to seeing this offering, and I was decidedly impressed by what I saw in its opening acts, but that was all wiped out by how this one ultimately played out, a picture that, in the end, ironically relied more on style than “substance.”",big difference funny laughable yet latest writer director coralie fargeat somehow found way amassing considerable amount largely well earned cinematic goodwill film opening segments picture mercilessly squanders support final act overlong meandering disgustingly gratuitous grotesque exhibition utterly bad taste story aging actress demi moore seeks revive career retrieving lost youth aid enigmatic injectable follows grand misadventures mysterious substance prompts emergence younger doppelganger margaret qualley becomes hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight make experimental venture work however two individuals must follow complex set rules dictates become increasingly difficult follow vie respective shares attention scenario unfolds tension grows leading complications unexpected developments become progressively harder manage works film ends story plays becomes stupendously absurd even though hearty laughs even ridiculously implausible unexplained occurrences try audience members patience tolerance much wait trainwreck end addition foregoing shortcomings film includes myriad changes tone making difficult determine whether supposed serious thriller campy road much way incomprehensible french offering titane also shamelessly borrows elements movies various ways notably imagery narrative references shining young frankenstein costume designs hunger games franchise bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts films like vertigo picture obvious heavy handed message perils misogyny observations important could easily stood turned notches yes get already time though also fundamentally innate questions narrative go wholly unanswered leaving us numerous head scratching moments sadly failings detract significantly elements work least early film fine performances moore qualley picture inventive cinematography central premise could made engaging story handled greater finesse strengths effectively cancelled ultimately results release goes rails indeed substance captured cannes film festival award best screenplay truly mind boggling certainly fan weird wild wacky release undermines virtues cherished qualities regrettably seriously looking forward seeing offering decidedly impressed saw opening acts wiped one ultimately played picture end ironically relied style substance,Positive
The Substance,Horror,"This takes a logical step on from Coralie Fargeat's earlier ""Reality+"" (2014) drama, only this time it takes a much more substantial swipe at all things vain. ""Elisabeth"" (Demi Moore) has been at the top of her fitness game for many a year when her boss ""Harvey"" (Dennis Quaid) decides that she's now too old and that a younger model is needed to present those programmes we all saw on the television of gorgeous, fit and healthy, people showing us how to exercise on a mat in from of our televisions each morning. Distracted by her imminent removal, she is involved in a car accident that introduces her to an handsome young nurse (Robin Grear) and then to a curious invitation to test out a mysterious fluid that can essentially give her her cake and eat it. In best ""Jekyll and Hyde"" tradition, injecting this quite literally creates a split personality. One is her current self, the other a perfect, younger specimen. They work in a rota system each gets a week of consciousness then has to take a week out. Thing is, the more vivacious character ""Sue"" (Margaret Qualley) is not so religious about sticking to these sharing rules and we quickly discover that what is ""borrowed"" can never been returned - with increasingly harrowing results. With the gushing ""Harvey"" determined to capitalise on his new ratings winner, things become decidedly irritating for the now marginalised ""Elisabeth"" - but shat can she do? There's no going back...! I think this is Moore at her best. Her palpable sense of evolving fury, exasperation and frustration is expertly captured as is the selfishness of her alter ego by an on form Qualley. Quaid steals his scenes as the truly odious epitome of corporate greed for whom it's all about the business, the money and never the actual people concerned. The denouement is reminiscent of something concocted by one of the David's - Lynch or Cronenberg, and allows the throbbing ghastliness of this story of vanity gone mad to demonstrate just how fickle life can be when there's little actual substance at all to their shallow and vacuous lives.

The Substance,Horror,"Certainly an experience!

<em>'The Substance'</em> is <b>a lot</b>. It's one of those sorta movies that I needed to let settle in my mind before I even started to think about reviewing it. I'm not even sure where to start. It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!

I think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, which I found to be solid enough but it came across, at least to me, as a bit too forced for shock value. This 2024 release has plenty of that, if not more, but it somehow feels totally at home with what surrounds it.

The story itself is fascinating, even taking out all the craziness with the gore et al. So by no means is this a film that is style over substance (sorry). It isn't anything actually overly original in terms of the base plotline, though the way it is portrayed and brought to life is astounding - every inch is expertly crafted.

Demi Moore is outstanding in this! I haven't seen her in much, at least anything released post-2002, but here she is top quality throughout. Margaret Qualley is obviously the opposite in terms of the former, though is just as fantastic in regards to the latter - great performance!

If you see anyone giving warnings ahead of watching this, they are very much warranted! Even with all the graphic twistedness, which will turn many away, this is an impressively enthralling picture.

The Substance,Horror,"**The Substance (2024)**
A Visceral Exploration of Youth Obsession and the Fear of Time

""The Substance"" is a bold cinematic experience that masterfully resurrects the practical effects of 1980s horror, delivering a visual and auditory feast that is both nostalgic and groundbreaking. Directed with a keen eye for detail, the film delves deep into society's obsession with youth and the inevitable passage of time, offering a thought-provoking commentary wrapped in visceral horror.
The film follows a renowned actress, portrayed by Demi Moore, who grapples with the fear of aging and losing her fame. In a desperate attempt to reclaim her youth, she becomes entangled with a mysterious substance that promises vitality but comes with horrifying consequences. As she navigates this treacherous path, the lines between reality and obsession blur, leading to a descent into madness.
At its core, ""The Substance"" is a critique of the 21st-century fixation on youth over the value of life experience. It echoes themes from classics like ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""The Picture of Dorian Gray,"" highlighting the shame associated with aging and the societal pressure to maintain perpetual youthfulness. The film questions whether society promotes a 'sexy reality' at the expense of genuine substance and wisdom.
The narrative explores the concept of cheating death, not just literally but metaphorically, as a fear of social death—being forgotten or replaced. This is poignantly portrayed through Moore's character, who embodies the desperation of clinging to relevance in a world that idolizes the new and discards the old.

**Practical Effects and Gore**
From the opening scenes, it's evident that the physical effects are a labor of love—a homage to the era before CGI dominated horror. The gore is unapologetically front and center, reminiscent of Cronenberg's ""The Fly,"" pushing the boundaries of on-screen grotesque. The disturbingly realistic blood effects, combined with meticulously crafted sound design, amplify the discomfort, making the audience squirm.

**Color Palette and Visual Aesthetics**
The color palette is meticulously crafted, bathing scenes in hues that evoke unease and familiarity simultaneously. The use of shadows and lighting enhances the suspense, while the wardrobe and costume design serve as narrative devices, illustrating the juxtaposition between youth and age, purity and corruption.

**Performances**
Demi Moore delivers a stellar performance, capturing the vulnerability and desperation of a woman battling the relentless march of time. Her portrayal adds depth to the film's themes, embodying the internal decay and obsession manifesting physically through the substance. The supporting cast also contributes significantly, with each character representing different facets of society's views on youth and aging.

**Critique**
While the film excels in many areas, it isn't without flaws. The ending feels abrupt, leaving several narrative threads untied, which may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Additionally, the persistent focus on teen emotional states can be grating, potentially alienating those seeking a more mature exploration of the presented themes.

**Engaging with the Hype**
""The Substance"" has generated significant buzz online, sparking discussions about its innovative use of practical effects and its deep societal commentary. The hype seems to stem from both horror enthusiasts who appreciate the throwback to classic techniques and audiences resonating with its timely themes. However, it's worth considering whether the film is merely feeding into the very cycle of superficiality it aims to criticize.


""The Substance"" is a visceral commentary on the fear of aging, the obsession with youth, and the inevitable march of time. It challenges viewers to reflect on their perceptions of age, experience, and what truly holds value. By drawing parallels with films like ""Gremlins,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" and ""Carrie,"" it positions itself as a modern amalgamation of timeless themes.
Despite its imperfections, the film succeeds in sparking conversation—a hallmark of impactful cinema. It's as uncomfortable as it is thought-provoking, demanding to be felt and discussed. Whether you love it or hate it, ""The Substance"" is a noteworthy addition to the horror genre that holds up a mirror to society's own fears and obsessions.

**Extra Thoughts**
- The film raises pertinent questions about our role in perpetuating the fear of aging. Are we complicit in creating a world where experience is devalued?
- The character dynamics suggest that embracing change and maintaining balance might be key to a fulfilling life, even if it comes at a cost.
- The hype surrounding the movie could reflect its resonance with audiences grappling with similar fears and obsessions in today's youth-centric culture.

**Final Recommendation**
""The Substance"" may not offer all the answers, but it provides a platform for dialogue on important societal issues. Its blend of classic horror techniques with contemporary themes makes it a film worth experiencing. If you're a fan of thought-provoking horror that goes beyond mere scares, this movie deserves a place on your watchlist.",substance visceral exploration youth obsession fear time substance bold cinematic experience masterfully resurrects practical effects horror delivering visual auditory feast nostalgic groundbreaking directed keen eye detail film delves deep society obsession youth inevitable passage time offering thought provoking commentary wrapped visceral horror film follows renowned actress portrayed demi moore grapples fear aging losing fame desperate attempt reclaim youth becomes entangled mysterious substance promises vitality comes horrifying consequences navigates treacherous path lines reality obsession blur leading descent madness core substance critique st century fixation youth value life experience echoes themes classics like death becomes picture dorian gray highlighting shame associated aging societal pressure maintain perpetual youthfulness film questions whether society promotes sexy reality expense genuine substance wisdom narrative explores concept cheating death literally metaphorically fear social death forgotten replaced poignantly portrayed moore character embodies desperation clinging relevance world idolizes new discards old practical effects gore opening scenes evident physical effects labor love homage era cgi dominated horror gore unapologetically front center reminiscent cronenberg fly pushing boundaries screen grotesque disturbingly realistic blood effects combined meticulously crafted sound design amplify discomfort making audience squirm color palette visual aesthetics color palette meticulously crafted bathing scenes hues evoke unease familiarity simultaneously use shadows lighting enhances suspense wardrobe costume design serve narrative devices illustrating juxtaposition youth age purity corruption performances demi moore delivers stellar performance capturing vulnerability desperation woman battling relentless march time portrayal adds depth film themes embodying internal decay obsession manifesting physically substance supporting cast also contributes significantly character representing different facets society views youth aging critique film excels many areas without flaws ending feels abrupt leaving several narrative threads untied may leave viewers unsatisfied additionally persistent focus teen emotional states grating potentially alienating seeking mature exploration presented themes engaging hype substance generated significant buzz online sparking discussions innovative use practical effects deep societal commentary hype seems stem horror enthusiasts appreciate throwback classic techniques audiences resonating timely themes however worth considering whether film merely feeding cycle superficiality aims criticize substance visceral commentary fear aging obsession youth inevitable march time challenges viewers reflect perceptions age experience truly holds value drawing parallels films like gremlins frankenstein christmas carol carrie positions modern amalgamation timeless themes despite imperfections film succeeds sparking conversation hallmark impactful cinema uncomfortable thought provoking demanding felt discussed whether love hate substance noteworthy addition horror genre holds mirror society fears obsessions extra thoughts film raises pertinent questions role perpetuating fear aging complicit creating world experience devalued character dynamics suggest embracing change maintaining balance might key fulfilling life even comes cost hype surrounding movie could reflect resonance audiences grappling similar fears obsessions today youth centric culture final recommendation substance may offer answers provides platform dialogue important societal issues blend classic horror techniques contemporary themes makes film worth experiencing fan thought provoking horror goes beyond mere scares movie deserves place watchlist,Negative
The Substance,Horror,"""The Substance"" is something of a cinematic mash up. 

First off, this story is somewhat  reminiscent of ""Death Becomes Her"". The 1992 film starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. 

The notion of the fatal conceit in the search for eternal youth amongst the ageing Hollywood set is very much central to the story in both films.

That said, the handling is distinctly different. This film is a lot louder, gaudier, brasher, cruder and ruder, than its 90's counterpart by a country mile. There are elements I'd typically associate with Lovecraft too, that are grotesque, monstrous and disturbing. 

This work is also more a visually clever, as opposed to a compelling narrative based experience. Its messages are conveyed, like Hollywood itself, through larger than life youthful glitz and glamour but also an innate, ephemeral shallowness.A shallowness that becomes a kind of obsessive prison, denying those trapped in it, any meaningful form of human intimacy.

My only criticism of what I do feel is a very good film, is it overplays its hand. Its so over the top in the latter part of the film, I felt it partly drowned out the message, it had, up to that point, convincingly conveyed. The closing scenes. in particular, felt crude, clumsy and would have worked considerably better, with more controlled and subtle, handling. 

In summary, ""The Substance"" is a rather clever film that uses the eye of the lens to expose how what we see, in Hollywood at least, is more important than who we are. People are shiny commodities to be replaced when the beautiful image they portray starts to wither away. As we see, youth and beauty is everything, no matter the price. 

I will say too, this is by no means a perfect cinematic experience. It can be over the top, especially in the latter part of the film. That said, there is, on balance, more to like here than not. Definitely worth a look.",substance something cinematic mash first story somewhat reminiscent death becomes film starring meryl streep goldie hawn bruce willis notion fatal conceit search eternal youth amongst ageing hollywood set much central story films said handling distinctly different film lot louder gaudier brasher cruder ruder counterpart country mile elements typically associate lovecraft grotesque monstrous disturbing work also visually clever opposed compelling narrative based experience messages conveyed like hollywood larger life youthful glitz glamour also innate ephemeral shallowness shallowness becomes kind obsessive prison denying trapped meaningful form human intimacy criticism feel good film overplays hand top latter part film felt partly drowned message point convincingly conveyed closing scenes particular felt crude clumsy would worked considerably better controlled subtle handling summary substance rather clever film uses eye lens expose see hollywood least important people shiny commodities replaced beautiful image portray starts wither away see youth beauty everything matter price say means perfect cinematic experience top especially latter part film said balance like definitely worth look,Negative
The Substance,Horror,"A disaster. It's an insult to the illustrious careers of Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid, who both deserve far better.

Until Dawn,Horror,"Sadly, there really isn’t much new to say about this derivative horror film. It’s the usual bunch of friends in the car routine, only this time it’s a woman-hunt they are on. You see, “Melanie” whom we very briefly meet at the start - has gone missing and so her sister “Clover” (Ella Rubin) has recruited her ex “Max” (Michael Cimino), best pal “Nina” (Odessa A’zion) and her new boyfriend “Abe” (Belmont Cameli) and the slightly spiritual “Megan” (Ji-young Yoo) to try to find out what happened. As the song goes: “if you go into the woods tonight, you’re in for a big surprise…” and so dodgy and ill-conceived decisions galore now ensue as the usual set-piece housebound horror kicks in and the story sort of lurches around like a gory version of “Groundhog Day”. The acting and writing vie for the award for being the blandest - especially the shockingly wooden Cameli, and the whole thing recycles itself to the point where I was quickly on the side of the perpetrator of these dastardly goings-on. What’s more annoying is that the plot did have some potential; it could have been better had the director relied less on the tried and tested formulae and taken a few risks with the story.

Until Dawn,Horror,"""Until Dawn"" is what I call ""Scoobie Do"" for adults. There's a group of pals, out for a vacation romp, who find themselves facing a mysterious back story and lots of supernatural baddies, out to croak them, in bloody style.

What makes this even worse than the usual formulaic, survivalist, horror nonsense, is its story is based upon a time loop. So, in essence, this is a horror flick, with obsessive compulsive disorder. The murder and mayhem repeats itself, stripping away even the basic sense of the unknown, as we stop wondering and worrying over, who is going to die and when. 

I can see how this would work in the context of a video game, which this film, is based upon. In games players die over and over, until they finally find a way to beat the game. As a film, its not a great idea, at all. A sense of lethargy and boredom sets in, as everyone dies over and over again.

I Know What You Did Last Summer,Horror,"Ben the Bream.

Kevin Williamson, hot off of the success of his screenplay for Wes Craven's Scream, here adapted the Lois Duncan novel with mixed results.

A bunch of pretty teenagers in a coastal fishing town run over a man in the road and try to cover it up. Not a wise move at the best of times, even more so now as the victim, a hook wielding fisherman, is coming to get them.

And that's pretty much it. Williamson adds some humour into the play, while director Jim Gillespie plays his shock tactics well and keeps the pretty young cast annoying enough for us to want to see the fisherman guy enact revenge.

It sadly gets away from itself in the last quarter once the stalker is revealed, and in truth there's very little imagination gone into the whole pic.

I Know What You Did Last Summer,Horror,"_**The guilt will haunt you and maybe even KILL you**_

Released in 1997, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" takes place in coastal North Carolina where a group of just-graduated teens experience a tragic event and compound it by foolishly reacting. They swear to carry the secret to their graves, but the next summer it becomes clear that someone knows their secret and murders start piling up. The teens are played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. Also on hand are Johnny Galecki, Anne Heche and Muse Watson.

This movie is full of slasher clichés, like the killer who's always in the same garb (this time a fisherman's slicker outfit), the slow-methodical walking of the killer (never running) and the undead dead. There are also two blatant ""Yeah, right"" scenes (noted below). Thankfully, it makes up for it by the stellar coastal locations (strangely shot on BOTH East and West coasts), a quality cast, some effective sequences and the potent moral on haunting guilt that slowly kills ya. The immediate aftermath of the opening accident is particularly well done.

The film runs 99 minutes and shot in Southport, North Carolina, and Jenner, California, and nearby regions of both coasts.

GRADE: B or B- (6.5/10 Stars)

***SPOILER ALERT*** (DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM)

Here are the two eye-rolling scenes:

1. The sequence where Max's corpse is found in the trunk with the crabs. It couldn't have been an illusion since Helen didn't yet know Max was dead, so it must've really happened. If so, how would the slicker-killer get the trunk cleaned-up so quickly with no one seeing him in a neighborhood in broad daylight? Also, how did he even get into trunk? Did he have his own personal key? The sequence is just too far-fetched.

2. After Barry is murdered by the killer at the pageant how does he know that the cop and Helen would be driving down the alley by-pass an hour or so later? (I realize the street was blocked off and he might've been the one who set it up, but how did he know this would be the precise route taken by the cop and Helen? And how would he even know Helen would be riding with the cop? It's not like she wouldn't have other friends & family in town with whom she could ride. Anyway, wouldn't people living in the downtown area or other passersby notice a man in full-slicker garb working on his truck?

Sequences like these take intelligent viewers right out of the story, which explains Roger Ebert's response: ""After the screening was over and the lights went up, I observed a couple of my colleagues in deep and earnest conversation, trying to resolve twists in the plot. They were applying more thought to the movie than the makers did.""",guilt haunt maybe even kill released know last summer takes place coastal north carolina group graduated teens experience tragic event compound foolishly reacting swear carry secret graves next summer becomes clear someone knows secret murders start piling teens played sarah michelle gellar jennifer love hewitt ryan phillippe freddie prinze jr also hand johnny galecki anne heche muse watson movie full slasher clich like killer always garb time fisherman slicker outfit slow methodical walking killer never running undead dead also two blatant yeah right scenes noted thankfully makes stellar coastal locations strangely shot east west coasts quality cast effective sequences potent moral haunting guilt slowly kills ya immediate aftermath opening accident particularly well done film runs minutes shot southport north carolina jenner california nearby regions coasts grade b b stars spoiler alert read seen film two eye rolling scenes sequence max corpse found trunk crabs illusion since helen yet know max dead must really happened would slicker killer get trunk cleaned quickly one seeing neighborhood broad daylight also even get trunk personal key sequence far fetched barry murdered killer pageant know cop helen would driving alley pass hour later realize street blocked might one set know would precise route taken cop helen would even know helen would riding cop like friends family town could ride anyway people living downtown area passersby notice man full slicker garb working truck sequences like take intelligent viewers right story explains roger ebert response screening lights went observed couple colleagues deep earnest conversation trying resolve twists plot applying thought movie makers,Negative

I Know What You Did Last Summer,Horror,"The ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" franchise has left a lasting impact on audiences, with the first film being particularly noteworthy for its thrilling and grounded portrayal of a vengeful antagonist. Ben Willis stands out as a compelling and underrated character, bringing a sense of realism to the story without delving into the supernatural realm. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. deliver captivating performances, drawing viewers in with their charisma and acting prowess.

The sequel, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" takes the characters on a harrowing adventure to an island, adding another layer of suspense and terror to the franchise. While some may overlook this installment as a credible sequel, the addition of Brandy Norwood as Carla contributes to the film's appeal and intensity.

However, the franchise takes a misstep with ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer,"" introducing supernatural elements that detract from the grounded nature of the original films. This departure from reality diminishes the impact of the storyline and characters, leading to a disappointing third installment that lacks the involvement of the main cast.

The television series based on the franchise offers a different but enjoyable take on the story, adding credibility and entertainment value to the overall franchise. While the series was cut short, fans are eager for a reboot that promises to bring fresh energy to the familiar tale. It is hoped that the original cast will return, providing a seamless continuation of the beloved saga akin to the success of the ""Scream"" franchise.",know last summer franchise left lasting impact audiences first film particularly noteworthy thrilling grounded portrayal vengeful antagonist ben willis stands compelling underrated character bringing sense realism story without delving supernatural realm jennifer love hewitt freddie prinze jr deliver captivating performances drawing viewers charisma acting prowess sequel still know last summer takes characters harrowing adventure island adding another layer suspense terror franchise may overlook installment credible sequel addition brandy norwood carla contributes film appeal intensity however franchise takes misstep always know last summer introducing supernatural elements detract grounded nature original films departure reality diminishes impact storyline characters leading disappointing third installment lacks involvement main cast television series based franchise offers different enjoyable take story adding credibility entertainment value overall franchise series cut short fans eager reboot promises bring fresh energy familiar tale hoped original cast return providing seamless continuation beloved saga akin success scream franchise,Positive
I Know What You Did Last Summer,Horror,"<em>'I Know What You Did Last Summer'</em> manages to satisfy, even if it isn't one of the strongest slasher flicks out there. The plot gets messy and the deaths don't stick out that much, though I was still suitably entertained. It is paced quite well, the run time flew by for me.

That's even with me having seen it before, way before I logged my thoughts online but I still remembered most of it. The cast, for me, are the best feature of this movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt is the standout, comfortably the best performer here in my opinion. Sarah Michelle Gellar is good too.

The dudes aren't as memorable, Freddie Prinze Jr. is decent but Ryan Phillippe's character is lame. It's interesting to see D. B. Cooper, I mean Muse Watson, involved though.

Alien: Romulus,Horror,"<em>'Alien: Romulus'</em> is actually very good.

Of the more modern day releases from this franchise, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.

The plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.

Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.

I also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.

All in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",em alien romulus em actually good modern day releases franchise one enjoyed immediately coming cinema plainly thinking solidly good however think fun seventh installment plot least set quite uncreative feel like many films series included crew make similar people similar characteristics motivations em crater em em em good get wrong recent examples spring mind happily though rest flick makes weakness area cailee spaeny david jonsson great performers found excellent throughout two actors want see much already seen pleasing pictures e g em civil war em em rye lane em also liked sound design even jump scares usually fan bit lazy etc enough works facehuggers remain brilliantly effective though xenomorph amazingly utilised human version hit felt em legend em esque one favourites franchise em alien em em aliens em narrowly better though marginal improvement entertaining em alien resurrection em surpasses every release eyes,Negative
Alien: Romulus,Horror,"I gather director Fede Alvarez made a conscious - and probably expensive - decision to keep the use of CGI to a minimum here and it really does work. ""Rain"" (Cailee Spaeny) and her ""brother"" are looking to get off-planet but she can't get travel papers from the all-powerful mining company. Desperate, she and ""Andy"" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys ""Tyler"" (Archie Renaux) and ""Bjorn"" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the ""Romulus"" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. ""Andy"" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of ""Rook"" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort ""Kay"" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a ""company"" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other ""Alien"" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, ""get away from her..."" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere.

Alien: Romulus,Horror,"Whilst not as awful as the Aliens franchise films that came after the excellent first and second films, starring Sigourney Weaver, Alien Romulus is not without its shortcomings. 

Whats immediately noticeable, in spite of the rugged, industrial setting, is a cast that look like they just escaped from the set of Beverly Hills 90210. Youthful, fresh faced, physically unimposing, with not a grease stain or blemish in sight, they feel badly out of place. 

If you can put the sense of disbelief regarding the casting aside (I couldn't) the actual story fares only marginally better. It feels like a borrowed affair, where its taken aspects of the first two successful films and tried to craft a newer iteration.

The results an alright, if at times, somewhat ridiculous story, punctuated by moments of compelling action. That said, haven't we seen it all before, in one form or another? 

In summary, miscasting combined with a story that blandly apes superior earlier films, leads to an ""okay"" watch that's fails to distinguish itself.If you are new to this franchise, my advice start with Alien from 1979 and then its plural successor Aliens, instead.",whilst awful aliens franchise films came excellent first second films starring sigourney weaver alien romulus without shortcomings whats immediately noticeable spite rugged industrial setting cast look like escaped set beverly hills youthful fresh faced physically unimposing grease stain blemish sight feel badly place put sense disbelief regarding casting aside actual story fares marginally better feels like borrowed affair taken aspects first two successful films tried craft newer iteration results alright times somewhat ridiculous story punctuated moments compelling action said seen one form another summary miscasting combined story blandly apes superior earlier films leads okay watch fails distinguish new franchise advice start alien plural successor aliens instead,Negative
Alien: Romulus,Horror,"Color me thoroughly surprised at how much I was delighted by “Alien: Romulus,” a highly creative, beautifully executed, pulse-pounding science fiction film from director Fede Alvarez. This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.

Going back to the roots of the “Alien” franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.

The strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn’t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn’t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise’s good will, it actually has some substance.

There’s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film’s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There’s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past “Alien” films.

I was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don’t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that’s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny’s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.

The film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.

“Alien: Romulus” is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it’s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.

""Alien: Romulus is an impressive technical spectacle that highlights Fede Álvarez's talent in creating an atmosphere of tension and horror, raising the audiovisual standard of the saga to new heights through immersive sound design and Galo Olivares' stunning cinematography, which deserves countless accolades.

However, its excessive reliance on references to the past prevents it from reaching its full narrative potential, as well as achieving a thematic impact similar to the franchise's best installments.

Despite this, the captivating performances of Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, along with a third act filled with insane entertainment, make this interquel a cinematic experience worth seeing in IMAX, even if it leaves the feeling that it could have been more daring and innovative.""

Alien: Romulus,Horror,"Well, it was done appreciating the first Alien film, but it’s still offered nothing new for me.",well done appreciating first alien film still offered nothing new,Positive
Alien: Romulus,Horror,"Alien: Romulus is a love letter to the 1979 classic, and while I dug the whole philosophical space-god thing in Prometheus, this stripped-down, back-to-basics approach had me hooked from the first frame.  It's been a while since an Alien film truly captured that sense of claustrophobic dread, and Romulus nails it.

This movie is gorgeous, plain and simple. The lighting, the camera angles, and Benjamin Wallfisch's score – it all blends together to create this constant tension that just sucks you in. There's this one scene where Rain, Andy and Tyler are being chased through the research station, the way they use the shadows and movement, it's like a masterclass in suspense. It totally reminded me of the most terrifying moments from the original. It's obvious Álvarez was obsessed with recreating that gritty, lived-in feel of the first Alien, and it pays off big time.

The cast is solid too. Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson absolutely kill it as Rain and Andy.  I'll admit, I was worried Andy would be your typical forgettable sidekick, but he actually gets a pretty interesting arc.  Sure, most of the crew are basically there to get picked off by the Xenomorph, but Andy was a standout supporting character. He basically played two roles. It's refreshing that the movie doesn't waste time with a bunch of unnecessary characters.

One thing this movie does really well is finding that sweet spot between horror and action that made the first two films so iconic.  Alien 3 was so bleak, and Resurrection was just bonkers action – this one feels like a proper blend of both.  Fede Álvarez basically throws in all the best Alien tropes: the ragtag crew, the creepy body horror stuff, the tense hide-and-seek scenes, and some kickass action sequences. And you know what? It totally works.

I was impressed at a lot of the creative set pieces and how they built tension. Like how they played with gravity to avoid the acid and trying to sneak past the facehuggers by camoflaging their body temperature. They were really cool and shockingly unique and fresh for a nearly 50 old franchise. And let's talk about that body horror. There's this one scene, a seriously messed-up vaginal birth, that is going to be burned into my brain for a while. Álvarez definitely gets what makes this franchise tick.

I'm giving Alien: Romulus a strong 7/10.  It lost some points for the use of the CGI Ian Holm. It's so distracting, and they rely on it way too much.  Also, there some lines that were stuck in there for nostalgia that felt out of place.  But honestly, those are minor nitpicks in a movie that's this much fun. The whole final act, with the station crashing into the asteroid field and that epic showdown with the Human/ Xeno, is just pure chaos in the best way possible.

I enjoyed this movie a lot. It didn't try to be edgy or special - it seems to be directed by a guy who loved the first 2 Alien movies from the 80ies and wanted to add a movie as best as he could do in our time which is still faithful to those 2 original movies and could be considered a worthy addition to the original ""Alien"" storyline.

The acting was overall very good. Cailee Spaeny as the lead actress gave a solid performance as expected. But the surprise of the movie was David Jonsson as her android ""brother"", who was the highlight of the movie actingwise for me.

Another main thing to mention are the effects and set desing. A lot of great practical effects, lighting and cinematography and the set design which is faithful to that of the first 2 Alien movies make this movie a great enjoyment for anyone who like the.

Alien: Romulus,Horror,"""Alien: Romulus"" is a visually admirable film, but it really has nothing new to show us and even worse than that it has nothing fresh to say. It is merely content to plunder inspiration from the preceding films and the only entry in the series which appears to be left unplundered is ""Alien 3"" (1992), but then this omission can hardly be described as surprising. After all, it isn't held in particularly high regard by the legions of loyal fans who absolutely adore these films for their often groundbreaking achievements and idolise the inexhaustible resourcefulness of Ellen Ripley. Unfortunately, these same loyal fans aren't going to find anything worth adoring or idolising in this latest effort. It is still a reasonably entertaining motion picture, but only because you can spend most of the running time attempting to guess which scene comes from which film in order to appease your overwhelming sense of disappointment with it all.",alien romulus visually admirable film really nothing new show us even worse nothing fresh say merely content plunder inspiration preceding films entry series appears left unplundered alien omission hardly described surprising held particularly high regard legions loyal fans absolutely adore films often groundbreaking achievements idolise inexhaustible resourcefulness ellen ripley unfortunately loyal fans going find anything worth adoring idolising latest effort still reasonably entertaining motion picture spend running time attempting guess scene comes film order appease overwhelming sense disappointment,Negative
Alien: Romulus,Horror,"The Alien franchise has had its ups and downs with mostly the latter in recent years. This latest one, which takes place in between Alien: Covenant and Alien in the timeline, is a solid entry from Fede Alvarez and is more in the vein of the first film in terms of look and tone.

Alien: Romulus,Horror,"Fede Álvarez delivers a film in Alien: Romulus that tries to revitalize the franchise but stumbles on several key aspects. While visually appealing and faithful to the oppressive atmosphere characteristic of the saga, the movie lacks a solid narrative and memorable characters.

The script relies too heavily on genre clichés, with bland dialogue and unconvincing decisions from its protagonists. Attempts to explore philosophical themes about survival and human nature remain superficial, leaving the impression that the film tries to tackle more than it can handle.

Álvarez’s direction, which has shone in the past with more intimate horror projects, feels overwhelmed in such an established universe. The moments of tension and terror fail to achieve the desired impact, falling into an uneven rhythm that alternates between dull and predictable.

For the most devoted fans of Alien, this installment is particularly disappointing. In an unfortunate parallel to Disney's mishandling of the Star Wars saga, Romulus feels like a production that prioritizes franchise formulas over true innovation or respect for the original spirit. Rather than expanding the Alien legacy, the film dilutes it, leaving a bitter aftertaste for fans who had expected much more.

28 Days Later,Horror,"It started off as rioting. But right from the beginning you knew this was different...

28 Days Later is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. It stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Megan Burns, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Ecclestone. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.

When animal liberation activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Center, they come across a scientist who tells them that to release these chimps would be insane. They have been injected with a test serum known as ""Rage"", and it's highly contagious and spreads easily and quickly. Ignoring the warnings, one of the activists opens a cage and is attacked and bitten by a chimp and rage quickly spreads among the group...

28 days later... 

The amazing thing with Danny Boyles's 28 Days later is that although it owes a huge debt to the likes of George Romero's zombie films, and John Wyndham and Richard Matheson's writings, it still feels fresh and exciting. Film is quintessentially British, as evidenced by the rightly lauded use of a depopulated London for the starting point to the terror, yet there's an earthiness to our small band of survivors. These are flawed characters that are ill equipped to deal with the infected implosion, there's nothing remotely Hollywood about these people or the landscapes that frame them (CG is minimal, where hand-held digital cameras are the order of the day). 

There's a realistic feel factor that is rarely seen in other films of this ilk. Yep, sure there's implausibilities, but with the infected creatures running at a fair old clip, becoming scary creations in a stark stripped back land, there's too much fun being had - and nervous tension being burnt - to even begin to start nit-picking. Besides, the last quarter alone is a lesson in energy fuelled horror as the survivors, having seemingly found a safe house, find that monsters aren't merely confined to the infected human kind. It's a cracker-jack of a finale, bloody and bloody frantic, all backed by Murphy's simple but totally potent musical arrangements.

It's easy to see why America made it a monster hit at the box office, after just making a small profit in the UK, film went to America and made it big. Americans, you have to feel, enjoyed watching something raw in a sub-genre of horror that was at the time reliant on Romero rediscovering his mojo. Worldwide the film made over $70 million in profit, and those are the kinds of figures that speak volumes. The success ensured a sequel would follow, where Boyle and Garland bowed out of the main chairs and into producers roles for ""28 Weeks Later"". It's not as raw as ""Days"", but it's gorier and itself also a fine ""infected"" horror movie, and certainly a worthy follow up to what Boyle and Garland clinically created in 2002.

2. The first to introduce a fast-moving ""infected"" horde, ratching up the tension significantly. 
3. The first to infect people instantly (within seconds). 

It also has one of the best movie scores, one that rivals those from John Carpenter classics ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing."" It is striking how the music can elevate a movie or a scene.

28 Days Later,Horror,"""28 Days Later"" is a British horror movie directed by Danny Boyle and starring Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris. The film tells the story of Jim (Cillian Murphy), a courier who wakes up from a coma to find London abandoned and overrun by rage-infected humans.

The film's opening sequence is one of the most iconic and powerful in horror movie history. Jim wakes up in a hospital room to find the world he knew has disappeared, and the eerily deserted streets of London make for an unsettling and ominous backdrop.

The film is expertly paced, with a gradual buildup of tension that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The infected humans are terrifying, fast-moving, and relentlessly violent, and the film's use of sound and lighting only heightens their impact.

One of the standout features of ""28 Days Later"" is the excellent acting by Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris. Murphy delivers a convincing performance as Jim, a man struggling to survive in a world gone mad, while Harris shines as Selena, a tough survivor who has learned to navigate the dangers of the new world.

The film's themes of survival, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit are powerful and thought-provoking. As Jim and Selena make their way through the deserted streets of London, they encounter a range of characters, each with their own story of survival and loss.

The film's cinematography and visual effects are also top-notch, with haunting and memorable shots of a deserted London and intense action sequences that will leave you breathless.

Overall, ""28 Days Later"" is a masterful horror movie that sets the bar high for the genre. The film's excellent acting, pacing, and visuals make for a truly unforgettable experience. I would rate ""28 Days Later"" a 8 out of 10.

28 Days Later,Horror,"Despite being warned that a group of monkeys about to be released from a lab by some anti-vivisectionists are laced with disease, they let one of them out anyway and next thing it's a month later and ""Jim"" (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in hospital all by himself. There's not a soul to be seen, anywhere. He can't spend the entire film wandering about naked, so finds some scrubs and goes exploring - gradually gleaning information about the plague that led to the evacuation of the cities and to his current isolation. It's not as if he had anything to do with the release of this virus, but he now has to deal with it's consequences. Luckily he encounters ""Selena"" (Naomie Harris) and ""Mark"" (Noah Huntley) who save him from a marauding mob (think ""Omega Man"" from 1971) and their risky adventures begin trying to find what's left of humanity and hopefully safety. A wind-up radio broadcast gives them some hope, and off they travel with newfound friends ""Frank"" (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter ""Hannah"" (Megan Burns) in their black taxi (so of course, it takes a circuitous route) to Manchester. Their arrival visits tragedy on the small group but also introduces them to the last bastions of military security - under the command of ""Maj. West"" (Christopher Eccleston). Pretty swiftly they realise that very little of this new scenario is much safer for them and their thoughts turn to leaving...! This is quite an effective apocalyptic tale of corrupted science and morals and uses, for most of the first section of the film, dialogue sparingly allowing the eerie photography and soundtrack of a largely abandoned London to set the scene for us. Thereafter the writing isn't the best, but the benign sense of menace exuded by Eccleston and the confidence of both Harris and the young Burns work well at giving us an almost claustrophobic sense of peril, especially as we drift to a denouement that is cleverly constructed to make us think. It's bleak and threatening at times, not without the odd dark humour and in the end presents us with quite an intriguing look at humanity in many of it's less attractive, more visceral, guises.

Death of a Unicorn,Horror,"<em>'Death of a Unicorn'</em> is potential-laden, though unfortunately I just never really got my teeth into this one. The whole set-up is severely underwhelming, the whole plot with the rich family just didn't do it for me. It does pick up at the conclusion, which is where I see the potential.

A movie solely about the Kintners and the unicorns could've been ace, especially if it lent into the fantasy side of it; almost if it was <i>(iffy association incoming)</i> <em>'How to Train Your Dragon'</em>-esque, just with all the gore and death that this 2025 releaes does hold. The final scene, as oddly over the top as it is, shows the promise.

Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega are decent in their respective roles, not that I have any core moments to take from either of them here though. The Leopolds, as much as I wish they weren't in the film, are portrayed well enough by those on the screen, Will Poulter is minorly amusing to be fair.

Death of a Unicorn,Horror,"There is something disappointingly formulaic about this comedy drama that really never quite comes alive. It doesn’t start so promisingly as we meet “Elliot” (Paul Rudd) who is travelling with his estranged teenage daughter “Ridley” (Jenny Ortega) to the remote wilderness home of his would-be benefactors whom he is hoping will give him power of attorney over a large lump of cash. “Odell” (Richard E. Grant) is the patriarch, and on his last legs; “Belinda” (Téa Leoni) is his wife and “Shep” (Will Poulter) his sharp as a spoon son - and “Elliott” is out to impress. Thing is, he is very late for their appointment. Why? Well they hit something on the road to the house and, well it isn’t the kind of thing you meet on the road every day - even if you are Tom Cruise. They assume this critter is no more, so imagine their surprise when it starts to make it’s presence felt in their host’s car park! A bit of research reveals not just what this is, but also that it’s blood could have miraculous healing powers (think phoenix’s tears). Could this be the miracle cure old “Odell” is looking for? Well more likely it is the source of grief for all concerned when it’s mum and dad realise it’s not come home to their cave for supper and set off, quite angrily, to retrieve their offspring. The story tries to introduce a little elemental fantasy to the proceedings, but with the possible exception of Leoni who seems to be prepared to go with the joke, the others aren’t really at the races. Grant resorts to uber-ham mode, Poulter tries but has little to work with and neither Rudd nor Ortega do much with this “Bambi” does “Jurassic Park” enterprise. There’s a fun role for Anthony Carrigan as their “Lurch” style factotum “Griff” - the only one in the whole thing who might actually have a brain, but otherwise this is all a triumph for girth over substance.

The Conjuring,Horror," It's November 1st, 1971, I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron, who with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.

The key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about ""nothing new on the table"" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.

There's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that ""haunt"" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.

Forget the ""based on a true story"" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means ""this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit"". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.

Story essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.

There is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.

The script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.

Met with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10

The Conjuring,Horror,"The Conjuring is a fairly classical horror/haunted house/exorcism movie. That was pretty much what I was hoping for. Slow and creepy build up to a final outburst and confrontation with an evil entity. This is a good movie although it is not really something new in terms of story. It is fairly impossible not to think about, and make comparisons with, The Amityville Horror when seeing this movie. I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting?

This is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.

One thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970′s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this “ghosthunter” make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.

The we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.

Anyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie. On the whole I was pleased. It was a nice to watch a movie that was going back to the traditional values in horror movie making and it was as well implemented as one could expect.",conjuring fairly classical horror haunted house exorcism movie pretty much hoping slow creepy build final outburst confrontation evil entity good movie although really something new terms story fairly impossible think make comparisons amityville horror seeing movie think really deserves glowing star ratings seen certainly merit star ones either people expecting solid effort making movie along classical lines supernatural possession wrote really something new nice see new movie using kind story without turning cgi gore feast sure movie also includes traditional pitfalls horror movies apparently must like people thinking good idea walk dark scary basement alone middle night one thing irked movie though idea phantoms performing exorcism presented kind normal accepted things movie would played years earlier maybe felt somewhat surreal see ghosthunter make presentations talk people like supernatural entities practice exorcism things happened ending course overly bad christ going exorcism damn stop procedure look lost every time something goes bump anyway sure whether going disappointed pleased sitting watch movie whole pleased nice watch movie going back traditional values horror movie making well implemented one could expect,Negative

The Conjuring,Horror,"<em>'The Conjuring'</em> is an extremely solid supernatural horror. I admit that I did find it less interesting as it went on, but even so I did comfortably enjoy seeing the progression of the story; I like that the plot doesn't majorly meander, each stage is clear.

It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares either, which is something I was expecting it to utilise. The supernatural elements here are very well done, we don't see terribly much of the demons, at least early on, so any appearances are effective. The stuff with the kids/mum is convincing too.

I was happy to see Vera Farmiga appear onscreen, I remember her fondly from 2011's <em>'Source Code'</em> and have wanted to see her in lead roles since - she's excellent in this. Patrick Wilson and Lili Taylor are also notable performers, while Joey King has one particularly great scene.

I'd class this as more creepy than scary, admittedly I seldom find movies scary (just the way my brain is wired with fiction). I can obviously still sense when something is unsettling though, anything with kids being possessed does the job in that regard.

Smile 2,Horror,"An improvement on the (good) original.

Naomi Scott's performance is outstanding, she is so convincing and fully committed to the role all the way through - to the point that she elevates the film as a whole up a notch. The rest of the cast are good, e.g. Rosemarie DeWitt, but <em>'Smile 2'</em> is very much Scott's movie.

The run time is perhaps a little longer than it needs to be, though to be honest that is only a minor criticism in the grand scheme of things.

Smile 2,Horror,"Tween horror.  Perfect to have on in the background whilst making tiktoks or like somthing I dunno lol.
I get the feeling the script for this was written in text speak and emojis.  I'm not sure if this is Blumhouse, I couldn't summon enough interest to bother finding out.

If you've seen the first flick (not movie and certainly not film), you know what this is about, cheese ""jump scares"" that solely rely on the sound being loud and some tween-palette friendly ""gore"" - a bit of blood.  Nothing's shocking, horrifying or engaging and the ""acting"" is terrible, which is maybe the most shocking element.

That guy that was in The White Lotus, I've seen be good in things other than this, he's not good in the 5 minutes or so he's in this.
Naomi Scott waddles round like a less obese version of Florence Pugh with even less charisma.  She's pretending to be a pop star, a story misstep that leads to some AI generated music that somehow sounds a decade or so dated.

Film could have been vastly improved if it was ~80 minutes of Scott being attack with a screwdriver, but that didn't happen and it's 2hours of mediocrity.  Looking at the sidebar here, it made money, so I guess we're getting Smile 3.

Smile 2,Horror,"I found it to be a significant improvement over the first installment. Naomi Scott's portrayal of Skye Riley is outstanding; she brings depth and authenticity to every emotional scene, making her character's journey compelling and relatable.

The film benefits from a higher budget of $28 million, compared to the original's $17 million, which is evident in its enhanced production quality. The opening prologue is particularly gripping, setting a tense and immersive tone right from the start.

Director Parker Finn adopts a more mainstream approach with effective jump scares and incorporates intense gore scenes that heighten the horror experience. The narrative cleverly blurs the lines between reality and illusion, keeping viewers on edge and questioning what's real.

The Monkey,Horror,"<em>'The Monkey'</em> has a great concept and I enjoyed the wacky nature of it, I did almost lose interest in the human characters towards the end though. That isn't the best sign given the short 90 minute run time, but the end does come when desired so that saves it.

Theo James is pretty good in this, for sure the most I've liked seeing him. I haven't seen him act much (five films now), my main thought of him is actually with human excrement up his nose (yep) in <em>'The Inbetweeners Movie'</em>... hopefully this performance will override that memory (it won't).

The Monkey,Horror,"This takes for ever to get going and once it does, it’s really an unoriginal semi-comedic horror drama centred around yet another not-so-menacing puppet. This time, it’s squabbling brothers “Hal” and “Bill” who discover an old hat box after their father dies and in it is what looks like a toy monkey. They wind it up and next thing, their babysitter is no more and that’s the just the start of it’s malevolence. Putting two and two together, they decide it’s best to drop the thing down a well and get on with growing up. Scoot on years later and now “Hal” (Theo James) has a son of his own “Petey” (Colin O’Brien) and is trying to rebuild some bridges with him after his marriage collapsed. Equally estranged is his twin, so he’s not impressed when, out of the blue, he is called and told their aunt has died. He now has to drag the reluctant lad along to the home they grew up in and guess what is in the wardrobe? At times it’s quite funny, but I’m not sure how intentional that is as James delivers a seriously flat performance and the epitome of sibling rivalries involves a frankly risible degree of menace. It’s not that the idea is rubbish, though it is derivative, it’s that the acting and writing are poor and the scenarios - familial discord, new stepdad (Elijah Wood) etc. are all just too predictable and it provides virtually nothing new over a lacklustre one hundred minutes.

Apocalypse Z: The Beginning of the End,Horror,"In spite of a exciting trailer Apocalypse Z fails to deliver. 

Perhaps the most immediately noticeable negative is the tiresome need to play politics. An anti-Russian sentiment is front and centre, throughout a large chunk of this film.

Looking beyond this, it takes far too long for what is essentially an action movie, akin to say ""World War Z"", to get off the ground. This film drags, at times, with sporadic moments of action, that never really amount to anything satisfying. 

In summary, if more emphasis had been placed on crafting a compelling story rather than playing politics, this might have amounted to a decent film.Certainly the cast is strong and the acting's excellent but on its own, its simply not enough.

Companion,Horror,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/companion-review/

""Companion may not reinvent the wheel within its genre, but the way Drew Hancock takes a familiar concept and infuses it with a personal touch and technically impressive execution results in an incredibly captivating viewing - especially for those who manage to avoid the criminally revealing trailers.

The blend of tones, the unsettling atmosphere, and the exploration of complex themes like abuse, love, and control elevate this horror flick beyond cheap jump scares, leaving a lasting emotional and narrative impact that lingers well past the credits. With a powerhouse performance from Sophie Thatcher anchoring it all, this psychological thriller - sprinkled with comedy, romance, and even sci-fi elements - stands out as one of the year's first big surprises.

Companion,Horror,"<em>'Companion'</em> is great! I was actually spoiled on the general gist of this due to the trailers, which I didn't even seek out but despite ignoring them pre-other flicks I still managed to catch what this was about. Happily, it didn't matter as the film lets the cat out fairly quickly.

I thought the aforementioned was going to be an issue, even though it is only a 90 minute movie I didn't think at that moment that it was going to have enough in the tank to make the overall movie enjoyable. I was wrong! It's a blast all the way through, there's a pleasant pace to it all.

Sophie Thatcher is brilliant, her showing is impressive and very convincing. That blood-soaked look is class. The rest of the cast aren't on Thatcher's level but are still positive parts of this film, namely Jack Quaid and Lukas Gage. Thanks to the short run time, this does fly by. Top film!

Companion,Horror,"We first meet ""Iris"" (Sophie Thatcher) and boyfriend ""Josh"" (Jack Quaid) as they take his self-drive car into the wilderness to meet with some of his friends at the home of millionaire ""Sergey"" (a delightfully over-the-top Rupert Friend). She's not at all keen on his pals. She thinks they look down on her. He tries to reassure her and when they arrive we are introduced to ""Kat"" (Megan Suri) and to loved-up ""Eli"" (Harvey Guillén) and ""Patrick"" (Lukas Gage). She was right, they don't much like her and at this point (for me, anyway) the penny started to drop. The married ""Sergey"" is supposed to be dating ""Kat"" but he's obviously a bit of a Lothario who tries it on with ""Iris"" and, well let's just say he probably wished he hadn't. Thing is, though, there's an whole load of manipulation going on here and it doesn't take ""Iris"", or us, long to realise that nothing is really as it seems. There's a fun chemistry on display here between Thatcher and Quaid and auteur Drew Hancock has crafted an entertaining scenario that avoids the standard cabin-in-the-woods style horror feature. This is a darkly comedic ""careful what you've wished for"" style of drama that has some decent menace intermingled with a few shades of Dan Stevens in ""Cuckoo"" from last year, too. For me, though, it's the dentally perfect Gage who steals the show proving the very point that true love isn't just skin deep and not everyone keeps their brains in their head! Amidst a tired and formulaic genre, this offers a refreshing change well worth a watch.",first meet iris sophie thatcher boyfriend josh jack quaid take self drive car wilderness meet friends home millionaire sergey delightfully top rupert friend keen pals thinks look tries reassure arrive introduced kat megan suri loved eli harvey guill n patrick lukas gage right much like point anyway penny started drop married sergey supposed dating kat obviously bit lothario tries iris well let say probably wished thing though whole load manipulation going take iris us long realise nothing really seems fun chemistry display thatcher quaid auteur drew hancock crafted entertaining scenario avoids standard cabin woods style horror feature darkly comedic careful wished style drama decent menace intermingled shades dan stevens cuckoo last year though dentally perfect gage steals show proving point true love skin deep everyone keeps brains head amidst tired formulaic genre offers refreshing change well worth watch,Negative
Companion,Horror,"Companion (2025) is another entry in the ever-growing “AI gone wrong” genre, but it does try to shake things up a little. The story is decent, keeping things interesting without dragging too much, though it still hits a lot of familiar beats. The twist on how the AI becomes a problem is a nice touch, but in the end, it doesn’t change the usual outcome. The climax is predictable, but it fits the film, so it doesn’t feel out of place.

Visually, the movie looks great. The locations are stunning, and the cinematography really helps set the mood. The directing keeps things moving at a good pace without overcomplicating anything. Sophie Thatcher is easily the standout here, she gives a great performance and makes her character feel real. The rest of the cast is fine, but she’s the one who really carries the film.

The script is simple but works for what the movie is trying to do. Some of the dialogue could have been sharper, but nothing feels awkward or forced. The music choice is solid, adding to the atmosphere without being too much. Overall, Companion is a fun watch if you like AI thrillers, but it doesn’t bring anything wildly new to the table.

Companion,Horror,"At first glance, “Companion” might seem like just another weekend-getaway-gone-wrong horror flick, but don’t be fooled. Writer / director Drew Hancock has crafted an incredibly fun and intense story that blends slasher thrills, sci-fi existentialism, and a sharp feminist edge into a blood-soaked ride that’s as entertaining as it is thought-provoking. This is so much more than an average popcorn movie, and it’s one of my favorites so far this year.

The film follows Iris (Sophie Thatcher), a seemingly ordinary woman who joins her boyfriend Josh (Jack Quaid) and his friends (Megan Suri, Lukas Gage, and Harvey Guillén) on a retreat to a remote cabin. The weekend takes a dark turn when secrets unravel, especially when it’s revealed that Iris is not what she seems. Without diving into spoilers, the film takes its time peeling back the layers of its characters, leading to a series of shocking revelations and a gloriously chaotic finale that fully embraces its campy, over-the-top nature.

The cast delivers tenfold, with terrific lead performances from Thatcher and Quaid. She carries the film with a mix of vulnerability, strength, and eerie unpredictability, while he seems like a natural with his turn as a less-than-perfect partner. The supporting characters are well-written too, from a smarmy Russian host (Rupert Friend) to Josh’s loyal friends who get caught up in the chaos.

While the story can feel familiar at times, it still manages to be wildly unpredictable. Hancock makes excellent use of the secluded setting to build suspense before unleashing the bloodbath, and he finds a good balance between comedy and horror.

Beneath the fun and carnage are some serious ideas about artificial intelligence, misogyny, toxic love, and the nature of autonomy. The film critiques the way women are conditioned to cater to harmful partners, explores the illusion of “perfect” relationships, and questions what it truly means to be human. The script handles these themes with thoughtful wit, balancing tension, dark humor, and a sense of empowerment that becomes more apparent as the story unfolds. You could easily and mindlessly enjoy this film at face value, but moviegoers wanting a bit more will not be disappointed.

Serving up a thrilling mix of horror, sci-fi, and feminist commentary, “Companion” is an absolute blast. Bloody, bold, and packed with fun twists, this story of power and identity is wrapped in a fun, violent, and gloriously campy package.

Companion,Horror,"Companion feels like an extended, uncomfortably intimate episode of Black Mirror. It shares the same eerie mix of dystopian technology, cool design, and digital paranoia. Everything appears clean on the surface, but something is deeply wrong underneath. Unlike Black Mirror, which often steps back to marvel at the dark potential of technology, Companion dives into something more grounded, more personal, and more brutal.

The horror here does not come from a rogue AI or a system glitching out. It comes from a man using high-tech tools not to solve a problem but to get exactly what he wants. What he wants is control, submission, and silence.

The sci-fi details, such as the rented android, the customization app, and the perfectly manicured suburb, are really just a thin disguise. Beneath it all lies a far more disturbing and all-too-recognizable truth: even if you build a woman from scratch, even if she is made of code and programmed to please you, that will not stop the harm. The abuse still finds its way in.

At first glance, Companion might seem like another entry in the growing list of AI-centered sci-fi films where artificial intelligence crashes into human emotion and chaos follows. But look closer, and you will see that it is not really about technology at all. It is about power, about control, about the kind of abuse that hides in plain sight, dressed up as love or connection.

This is not a story about machines breaking down. It is about a man who thinks love means ownership. It is about the emotional, social, and technological systems that allow that belief to thrive. The violence in Companion is not an accident. It is the logical conclusion of the world Josh creates a world where he is never challenged, never vulnerable, and never forced to see the woman in front of him as a person.

What makes Companion so haunting and so effective is how it uses AI not to speculate about the future but to hold up a mirror to the present. Misogyny does not vanish as technology evolves. It simply finds new ways to survive. When that buried female rage finally surfaces, it is not a glitch or revenge. It is survival, long overdue and deeply human.

This is not really a film about the future. It is a reflection of the present. What it shows us is uncomfortable, familiar, and impossible to ignore.",companion feels like extended uncomfortably intimate episode black mirror shares eerie mix dystopian technology cool design digital paranoia everything appears clean surface something deeply wrong underneath unlike black mirror often steps back marvel dark potential technology companion dives something grounded personal brutal horror come rogue ai system glitching comes man using high tech tools solve problem get exactly wants wants control submission silence sci fi details rented android customization app perfectly manicured suburb really thin disguise beneath lies far disturbing recognizable truth even build woman scratch even made code programmed please stop harm abuse still finds way first glance companion might seem like another entry growing list ai centered sci fi films artificial intelligence crashes human emotion chaos follows look closer see really technology power control kind abuse hides plain sight dressed love connection story machines breaking man thinks love means ownership emotional social technological systems allow belief thrive violence companion accident logical conclusion world josh creates world never challenged never vulnerable never forced see woman front person makes companion haunting effective uses ai speculate future hold mirror present misogyny vanish technology evolves simply finds new ways survive buried female rage finally surfaces glitch revenge survival long overdue deeply human really film future reflection present shows us uncomfortable familiar impossible ignore,Negative
The Ugly Stepsister,Horror,"Now I don’t suppose you’d have kicked “Prince Julian” (Isac Calmroth) out of bed for eating herring, but right from the start this apple of everyone’s eye looks distinctly dull! I’m not sure that the besotted “Elvira” (Lea Myren) realised that when she embarked on quite a tortuous make-over to turn her chubby and buck-toothed body into something that might turn the head of this royal highness, but needs must when the debt collectors are circling. This is probably the most grotesque take on the “Cinderella” story you are ever like to see, as it pretty graphically shows the life of this young girl, her stepsister, her mother and her downright cruel Svengali who thinks nothing of stitching her eyelids on or rearranging her teeth - without, of course, any anaesthetic. Where this also drifts away from the more traditional approach is the venality of the whole thing. “Elvira” is certainly a victim of greed, but it’s more a sort of uneducated and vulgar kind from her guardian rather than anything more spiteful or hateful. Moot point? Well, not really as in the end it is actually quite difficult to actually loathe this family desperate to climb the silky pole. I almost felt sorry for all of them. It’s gory, there’s a fair smattering of sex and our princeling can even turn his hand to poetry - though not the stuff that Yeats might have to worry about. The production has been eerily and effectively crafted with plenty of detail in the settings and costumes, and the overall message of style over substance and social and sexual conformity is writ large throughout. It turns out that there are more ways than one to get your foot in that slipper, and not all of this will be for the squeamish.

Train to Busan,Horror,"**Horror express.**

A week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.

Directed by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean cliché where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.

But in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.

> ""Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.""

This is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.

In the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level.

There are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.

I have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!

Train to Busan,Horror,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend for those looking for a new zombie movie to watch.

This one really had me yelling at the screen: I was heavily invested....until I was basically emotionally exhausted.  I don't think I reacted quite how the director wanted me to react during that last act.

This is a fascinating premise.  A zombie outbreak that leaks onto a train (with just one infected), and these are ""World War Z"" running, 15 seconds to turn (usually) zombies.  I'm staunchly against running zombies, but when you do something well, it is really hard to discredit you for it.

There is one aspect that is truly odd for zombies, but it would be quite the spoiler, it's basically the 3rd act (out of 4).  The writing structure feels very different, it doesn't seem to adhere to a 3 act staple: it really feels like 4 acts broken into chapters (or levels similar to a video game) and as whichever characters survive the transfer from chapter to chapter, the story progresses.  There is clearly though pre-infection establishing act, post infection establishing act, confrontation act, and resolution act.  Once you get past the first act, it's pretty much non-stop action, by the by.

The one frustrating part about this movie is that most of the characters seem to have a death wish: despite trying to stay alive, they all seem to want to die.  I understand that a story can't happen without flawed characters, but the things these people do are so remarkably stupid sometimes that the zombies become more believable at times.  It does allow for some of the more amazing scenes though, so it might be somewhat forgiveable.

Train to Busan,Horror,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

Zombie apocalypse is far from being a groundbreaking subgenre. The Walking Dead franchise is arguably the most popular show on Earth when it comes to portraying this supernatural future. World War Z and the Zombieland duology play that role in the movies' realm. However, all of these works fail to reach the always high expectations that come with a story set in a time like this. When people ask, ""what's the best zombie apocalypse film ever?"", one doesn't have a clear answer simply because there isn't an outstanding, mind-blowing, near-perfect flick. Well, at least not until 2016, the year of release of the best movie in the genre, Train to Busan.

I genuinely feel sorry for everyone who refuses to watch foreign films for whatever reason. A different language and/or the display of subtitles shouldn't be enough to convince viewers to ignore so many unique works from all around the world. If someone dares to call themselves a ""zombies fan"" and has not watched Train to Busan yet, then ""fan"" is far from being the right description. This is South Korean cinema at its best. Everyone is 200% committed to their role, whether that is a stunt man or one of the protagonists. Yeon Sang-ho delivers a powerfully suspenseful, intense, epic, and most of all, heartbreaking story with the help of a phenomenal screenplay written by Park Joo-suk.

When the only ""negative"" aspect that I can find is related to ""maybe not-that-logical"" specific actions performed by some characters, I know that I'm nitpicking a near-perfect movie. I struggle to find a single real issue with the entire film. In my opinion, the reason why the latter works so well is largely due to Park Joo-suk's script. Usually, people always think about the zombies first: how do they look? How do they act? Do they run wildly or stroll? Which new attributes or skills do these zombies have different from what we've seen until now? How did it all begin? Is there a cure? Granted, the zombies look cool, and Yeon Sang-ho is able to create impressive action sequences filled with maximum intensity and extreme tension. Entertainment-wise: top-notch.

However, the action only works as well as it does due to the emotional bond that the viewer shares with the (non-infected) human characters. These are beautifully treated and developed in such a remarkable manner. There are easily five to six characters that the viewer ends up caring deeply about. Typically, at least half of this group is expendable in this type of film because some characters show no signs of intelligence or are just douchebags. In Train to Busan, every single character possesses likable traits, besides being directly connected to each other (father-daughter, young couple pregnant). The action scenes are filmed in incredible fashion, but it's the encompassing emotional aura that ultimately elevates them.

It's really an emotionally devastating story. The viewer is placed in dozens of situations that require the hardest of choices from the main characters. The generic dilemma ""do I save the person I care about or everyone else?"" is taken to a whole other level with exceptional dialogues, filled with an excruciating amount of suspense, leaving me about to tear up on more than just a couple of times. Every character has a terrific, compelling arc. The main protagonist, Seok-woo (Gong Yoo), goes from being a despicable character, one that I wouldn't mind seeing killed in the first fifteen to twenty minutes, to a lovable father that only wants what's best for her daughter, protecting her at all costs during the apocalypse.

This movie is packed with clever social commentary, relatable to this day (and even more during the current global pandemic). Yon-suk (Kim Eui-sung) represents everything that's wrong with our society. A selfish man who thinks he's more important than everyone else due to his class and whose job is more significant than his own family or friends, let alone strangers on a train. He also works as a ""wake-up call"" to our protagonist, as a ""what if"" version of Seok-woo's future if he continues to only focus on his job. Another character of great relevance is Sang-hwa (Ma Dong-seok), a father-to-be who ends up protecting Seok-woo's daughter when her father can't. His bravery and selflessness make him an instant audience favorite.

Technically, it's genuinely a flawless film. From the outstanding zombie makeup to the mind-blowing stunt work, everything action-related serves as evidence to prove that South Korean cinema does action a thousand times better than conventional Hollywood. The level of intensity is ridiculous. Lee Hyung-deok's camera work is absolutely brilliant, moving through the train seamlessly, letting the viewer see and understand everything. Aided by excellent editing (Yang Jin-mo) and a phenomenal score (Jang Young-gyu), Yeon Sang-ho generates tension and suspense in a way that makes every single action sequence feel overwhelming, powerful, and even epic.

A runtime close to the two-hour mark that flies by. The first act perfectly sets up the apocalypse to come with a surprisingly subtle build-up of the exponentially growing chaos. Then, the outbreak in the train which occupies most of the movie's duration. During this period, everything happens. From the nail-biting action sequences to the emotionally powerful moments of character decisions that make this film so shocking. Finally, a third act that left me floored, completely drained of emotions, not knowing exactly how to feel after it all ended. Despite a couple of sequences that I believe were exclusively executed in the way they were to offer an emotionally climactic moment, everything else feels impressively realistic.

All in all, Train to Busan is arguably the best zombie apocalypse movie of all-time, at least, until the date of this review. The subgenre finds in Yeon Sang-ho's mind-blowing flick the masterpiece it deserves. From the exceptionally subtle build-up to the emotionally devastating final act, passing through the most vivid, suspenseful, tense depiction of a zombie outbreak ever put to screen, Park Joo-suk's screenplay is the reason why this film succeeds so well. A heartbreaking story featuring astonishingly well-developed characters, surrounded by a powerfully resonant social commentary, even more in the current days. Action-wise, it's South Korean cinema at its best: maximum intensity, phenomenal camera work, seamless editing, chill-inducing score, outstanding commitment from everyone involved, and a fantastic stunt team. Hollywood should learn from movies like this. I can't find a single flaw. It left me emotionally drained. If you're a fan of cinema, no matter the genre, this *must* be on your watchlist!

There are parts of this movie I really like. It is almost like gothic poetry painted onto the screen and in a way it is beautiful. Another part of me was a little disappointed with a certain look Nosferatu had. I thought he would looke more like the classic but once I put that aside I truly enjoyed this movie. Lily Depp's physical performance actually surprised me and she deserves some recognition for it.",devil world met parts movie really like almost like gothic poetry painted onto screen way beautiful another part little disappointed certain look nosferatu thought would looke like classic put aside truly enjoyed movie lily depp physical performance actually surprised deserves recognition,Positive
Nosferatu,Horror,"<em>'Nosferatu'</em> didn't quite hook me, but there is enough about it that I can consider it as a good film. The visuals are splendid, as are the gothic horror elements. On the cast, Lily-Rose Depp impresses, as does (more minimally) Emma Corrin and I'm always happy to see Willem Dafoe.

I do continue to feel quite nonplussed by Nicholas Hoult. I did like him in fellow 2024 release <em>'Juror #2'</em>, but in this I've kinda reverted to feeling unmoved by him onscreen. I'm not entirely sure why as he seems a likeable chap, yet his performances just don't really register - which admittedly sounds harsher than I intended.

Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok is also a part of this flick that I'm unsure on. Does he look the real deal? Absolutely, no complaints there, but I particularly found the dialogue with him to be a borderline bumbling mess. I found the scenes directly with Count to be the least interesting.

I would also say that the movie goes on for a bit too long, though I admit that probably is more of a personal shout than one that is to be set in stone; because if you love this, it'll be the perfect length I'm sure. For me, I feel like they went around the houses a tad. With that said, I did highly enjoy that final scene with Depp - very good!

Those last paragraphs make it sound like I have a dislike for this film. I do not. It just has some noteworthy points that I felt the need to mention. As I type, having not looked at how this has been received, I'd be shocked if this wasn't rated high. Either way, this is worth a watch.

This is my third Robert Eggers film. I loved <em>'The Northman'</em> (9/10) but I, honestly, hated <em>'The Lighthouse'</em> (4/10). Safe to say this falls exactly down the middle, in terms of how I think of it.

Nosferatu,Horror,"""Tom"" (Nicholas Hoult) is lovingly married to ""Ellen"" (Lily-Rose Depp) but they haven't much money. That could change, though, as his boss ""Knock"" (Simon McBurney) charges him with a very special mission. He must travel from his German home to the mountains of Carpathia where he must facilitate the sale of a ruined manor house to the reclusive ""Count Orlok"" (Bill Skarsgård). His journey is riddled with portents of suspicion and doom; those he encounters warm him to turn back - but on he goes until he arrives at the castle and is greeted by his enigmatic host. What he thinks is the contract to seal the deal on the house is anything but, as he is soon tormented in his dreams. Many hundreds of miles away, his wife is also suffering - and that causes his best friend ""Friedrich"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to call in ""Dr. Sievers"" (Ralph Ineson) who in turn looks to the scientifically ostracised ""Prof. von Franz"" (Willem Dafoe) for some answers. There are no tangible causes, and the professor quickly concludes that it is evil that's at work and that the continuing and inexplicable absence of her husband, his employer and a recently arrived plague of rats are all part of the supernatural causes of her melancholy. There might be a solution, but that requires an act of supreme sacrifice on the part of the young ""Ellen"", or can her husband and his friends find another way? I'm not really a fan of two-parters, but I think in this case that might have been a better solution for Robert Eggers. We have a brief historical introduction to the Count and to the underlying cause of all of the troubles for ""Ellen"" but for the first hour of the film we don't really develop the characters enough, nor sow the seeds for the mysticism especially well. He relies too heavily on our knowledge of the Galeen story of ""Nosferatu"" (as opposed to the Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" one). I could have done with more depth to that chronology. Once ""Orlok"" is on his voyage and afterwards in the town where his merciless behaviour causes misery and panic, we seem to hit the accelerator and rush to the conclusion as if the cock really were about to crow any minute. There simply isn't time to allow the menace to accumulate. Though the visuals are impressively bleak, most of the acting is remarkably bland. Hoult manages to exude some decent terror now and again, but ATJ is really wooden; it takes too long for Depp to show us what she can bring to this under-exposed character and we just don't see anywhere near enough of the ghoulish ""Orlok"" to understand what this story is essentially all about. It's a gothic, dark, gloomy love story. A story of deceit and betrayal and I wanted more. I wanted to feel a little more invested in the characters: to sympathise, to pity, to fear, even. Perhaps a director's cut is in the offing? It's a great watch on a big screen, but I have to admit to being just a little disappointed.",tom nicholas hoult lovingly married ellen lily rose depp much money could change though boss knock simon mcburney charges special mission must travel german home mountains carpathia must facilitate sale ruined manor house reclusive count orlok bill skarsg rd journey riddled portents suspicion doom encounters warm turn back goes arrives castle greeted enigmatic host thinks contract seal deal house anything soon tormented dreams many hundreds miles away wife also suffering causes best friend friedrich aaron taylor johnson call dr sievers ralph ineson turn looks scientifically ostracised prof von franz willem dafoe answers tangible causes professor quickly concludes evil work continuing inexplicable absence husband employer recently arrived plague rats part supernatural causes melancholy might solution requires act supreme sacrifice part young ellen husband friends find another way really fan two parters think case might better solution robert eggers brief historical introduction count underlying cause troubles ellen first hour film really develop characters enough sow seeds mysticism especially well relies heavily knowledge galeen story nosferatu opposed bram stoker dracula one could done depth chronology orlok voyage afterwards town merciless behaviour causes misery panic seem hit accelerator rush conclusion cock really crow minute simply time allow menace accumulate though visuals impressively bleak acting remarkably bland hoult manages exude decent terror atj really wooden takes long depp show us bring exposed character see anywhere near enough ghoulish orlok understand story essentially gothic dark gloomy love story story deceit betrayal wanted wanted feel little invested characters sympathise pity fear even perhaps director cut offing great watch big screen admit little disappointed,Negative

Nosferatu,Horror,"""Nosferatu"" tries far too hard to be something, it could more readily have been, with a lighter touch.  

You can see what they are going for, a creepy noir, horror fantasy. The problem is, it feels obsessively over stylised, to the point of leaden Gothic oppressiveness. Its a quality that infects the characterisations, as well. They feel over stated, too much larger than life (or is that death) and as a a result, at times, farcical. 

The story itself, to those who have read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", is mostly familiar.  A few amendments have been made to bring it more in line with the original  ""Nosferatu"" directed by F. W. Murnau, way back in 1922. Count Dracula has been replaced by Count Orlock, for example. I did feel the ending (which also departs from the novel) was a ""bit thin"" and somewhat underwhelming.

I will say, in spite of its limitations, I don't hate this film. Its clear a lot of effort and care has been invested into its creation. I think too, certain dramatic and visual aspects of the Gothic film noir approach, are creepily memorable. 

In summary, ""Nosferatu"" is a valiant effort that would have been markedly better with gentler handling. A balance of the dark aspects of the film with a more subtle, lighter approach would have led to a superior final product.

Nosferatu,Horror,"Nosferatu (2024) marks the third remake of the original 1922 film, and at this point, you have to wonder, how many times do we need to see this story retold? It’s also part of a ridiculously long list of Dracula-related films, with nearly 95 adaptations floating around. While this version brings fresh cinematography and a chilling atmosphere, it doesn’t reinvent the story in any significant way. The plot follows the familiar beats of Count Orlok’s eerie presence and growing obsession, but it takes its time getting anywhere. The directing leans heavily into gothic horror, which works for setting the mood, but sometimes it feels more focused on aesthetics than storytelling.

Visually, the film is stunning. The cinematography is easily its strongest aspect, with haunting lighting, deep shadows, and eerie textures that create a cold, unsettling world. The acting is another highlight, with Bill Skarsgård delivering a terrifying and tragic performance as Orlok. The rest of the cast holds their own, adding depth to the horror. However, the script is where things get shaky. Some moments shine, but others feel drawn out or unnecessarily stiff, making the film drag in parts. The score does a solid job of building tension, though it doesn’t always hit as hard as it could.

One of the strangest creative choices is the inclusion of an oud and belly dancing in Transylvania during Thomas Hutter’s arrival. The scene is heavily choreographed, with villagers giving him a grand welcome that feels eerie and almost ritualistic. It’s a visually striking moment, but the film never explains its purpose. The oud and dance are Middle Eastern cultural elements, not something tied to Transylvania’s history, and after this elaborate introduction, they are never mentioned again. A single question about it is quickly dismissed, making it feel like the filmmakers threw it in for exoticism without considering whether it made any sense. Nosferatu (2024) is a visually impressive and well-acted film, but its slow pacing, script issues, and odd cultural inaccuracies hold it back.

Nosferatu,Horror,"**_Basically, Robert Eggers’ version of Coppola’s “Bram Stoker’s Dracula”_**

In 1838, a newlywed couple living in a town on Germany’s coast on the Baltic Sea are challenged by the troubling dreams of the wife (Lily-Rose Depp) and the husband’s long business trip to Transylvania (Nicholas Hoult). The excursion to the castle of Count Orlok (Bill Skarsgård) takes an utterly frightening turn, but the worst is yet to come when the Count makes it to his decrepit manor in Wisburg.  

“Nosferatu” (2024) was written & directed by Eggers, who was inspired by Henrik Galeen's screenplay for the 1922 film, as well as Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. There are also bits borrowed from “Suspiria” (1977), ""Castle Freak"" and various possession flicks, like “The Exorcist.”

However, I was most reminded of Coppola’s 1992 version of the story. All the main characters are in both movies, just with different names and the Eastern Europe locale switched from London to the fictional Wisburg, Germany. Instead of Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing you have Willem Dafoe as von Franz; in place of Tom Waits as Renfield, there’s Simon McBurney as Knock; instead of Sadie Frost as Lucy, there’s Emma Corrin as Anna; and so on.

Like Coppola’s movie, the production quality is first-rate. Yet this is way scarier and unsettling and, definitely, the creepiest version of the Dracula I’ve seen on film. But it’s not as lush, sexy or entertaining as “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” not to mention Frank Langella’s 1979 version and many of the Hammer flicks. While this lacks the infamous love story that Coppola & writer James Hart added to Stoker’s tale, it still has something akin to that with Orlok’s attraction to Mina, um, I mean Ellen (Depp).

It kept my interest for the first half, but started losing it in the second (Coppola’s film had the same issue, just not as much). Yet I liked the ending; and the real European locations are preferred over Coppola’s studio-bound sets (which were top-of-the-line; I just favor real locations).

The film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, with the Extended Cut running four minutes longer (which is the version I saw). It was shot in the Czech Republic at Barrandov Studios in Prague with location shooting done at Rožmitál pod Třemšínem Castle and Pernštejn Castle, as well as Prague's Invalidovna complex. In addition, some exterior shots were done in Corvin Castle in Romania.

Nosferatu,Horror,"Well, it's not woke, so it gets points for not screaming POLITICS! POLITICS! POLITICS! at you at the top of it's lungs.  And honestly, that's enough of a novelty to make it passable. It's so rare these days that when you see a movie that's not about pushing a political message, you sort of like it out of principal.  None of the characters are race-swapped, and the audience is so used to seeing period films set in Europe's past with openly Gay characters and Black leads for established white characters, that seeing people who look like they fit the demographics for the location and time the film was set in is... refreshing.

It's just made to entertain, it tries to keep true, visually, character-wise, to what the source material said, and we need more of that.  We want more of that.

But then, it's not exactly good either.  The pacing is off, I mean it's really off.  It seems to all come too fast to really set in as a story.  It needs to take it's time a bit more.  It needs to let the setting and characters settle more... but unfortunately it doesn't.  It just moves from one beat to the next at lightening speed and, honestly, that sort of kills it on a story perspective.  The plot suffered from it too, the fast pace took away from the establishment, so even the Velma information dumps didn't have time to settle.

I have to give a shout out to Lily-Rose Depp, she did try and sell the character.  She was actually better than Willem Dafoe, who needs a Razzy for this. His performance was a little too silly for a horror movie. It was like he was intent not to play it straight and over-acted a bit too much, so much it wouldn't have even played on the stage. Bill Skarsgård wasn't bad, but again, a little over the top. 

Let's face it, in the 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s this would have been considered bad.  The ratings would have been lower, but it's the 2020s, and the fact that it was just made to tell a story, just made to entertain, made with no lectures, no politics, that redeems it, that sets it apart.  People like it more because it left out the crap that they are tired of having rubbed in their faces every day.
